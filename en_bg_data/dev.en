The ships that sail the Mediterranean are not the same ships that sail the Atlantic, and vice versa.
(PT) Madam President, I would like to begin by pointing out the importance of relations between the United States and the European Union, particularly during a time of global economic crisis.

Retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles (vote)
The debate is closed.
Then, a wide-ranging aid programme would make sense; wide-ranging and not limited to one or two branches of the economy.
I, too, am delighted to be back here with you, as I am every month.
(LT) Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important issue today, particularly as regards the European Union's neighbourhood.
However, over and above the uncontested political significance of the decision, speculative attacks have, unfortunately, continued - and even increased - over the last 24 hours, fed by certain ambiguities surrounding the support mechanism - which, Mr President of the Council, must be cleared up post-haste - and by rumours of unknown origin and purpose, of which various versions are circulating, the most recent version, which appeared in Greece the other day, being that there has been a call for the agreement of 25 March to be renegotiated.

I believe that Romania offers a model of good practice for very many countries in the European Union.
Not only are we building a new block in Luxembourg, leading to more carbon emissions that could well contribute to climate change - or not, depending on what one believes on the issue - but also it is simply hypocritical for us to carry on debating climate change while we continue to operate out of three places of work.
This is an area in which Europe can make sense, by adding value to the management of one of the most unequivocal dimensions of globalisation, namely the unprecedented dimension taken on by migration, and therefore migratory flows and their impact in all areas of importance to European integration.

I support the position that current economic austerity and the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty may help Member States towards smarter spending on defence by pooling and sharing a larger proportion of their defence capabilities, budget and requirements, while achieving more security for their citizens, although the reality is that the economic and financial crisis affects EU national defence budgets, programmes and force structures and, therefore, more than one year after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, there are not yet clear signs of a post-Lisbon EU holistic approach enabling traditional procedural and institutional barriers to be overcome.
The surging suppression of the opposition must be brought up at the summit and the opposition parties must be allowed to register.

In this regard, Parliament and the Council have the same objectives, and this, of course, applies everywhere, in all areas and to all institutions.
The Treaty, with the ensuing 'Community method', implies full respect for the role of all the European institutions.
However, having said that, and because I cannot stop EU citizens using exotic and tropical timber, it is important that these agreements are adopted.
Closure of sitting
The major causes behind the abandonment of children are poverty, inadequate social welfare systems, the lack of a sufficient social infrastructure network or adequate public services, as well as conflicts and military interventions.

Mr President, the regulation that is being discussed today has been largely disregarded by all the committees over a long period.
Apparently their words were worth nothing.
The flat-rate compensation that has been called for, which is to be paid from the first day on which the payment becomes late, represents a tangible method of preventing this.

They are afraid that patients will travel to countries where they will not have to wait months or years for an operation like they do at home.
In this context, it also seems important to me that the European Parliament should correct one item in the Commission's proposal in its resolution: as in the Baltic region, an important international agreement for joint cooperation on river-related issues already exists; this agreement represents a consensus and has resulted in this joint statement which permits the conservation of the river, while, at the same time, allowing for its development as a transport route for ships.
Here we are already in the budget procedure proper and the vote here will constitute the final result.
This resolution suggests much to counter the negative provisions of the original text.

This is why we need to reduce the segmentation of our labour markets.

This place is in the middle of this Chamber, behind the podium, because you are the Council, the Commission and also Parliament.

It is important, therefore, that consumers are aware of how much energy is used by their equipment, and so I think they have the right for that information to be on the labels.

For companies within EU countries, there would be gains if we could tackle barriers to public procurement, to the medical devices market - where there is insufficient recognition of international standards, to services - including financial services and postal services, and access for SMEs.
This is compounded by the fact that at the same time, the most brutal crimes committed against Hungarians are not investigated.

Next year, there will be significantly greater numbers of international personnel in Afghanistan.

If you really want to vote on the original text, we can go back, but the general mood seems to be to carry on, I think.

The House voted last September that EUR 600 million should be made available.
Honourable Members, we have to do as much as we can to support countries across the world.

By guaranteeing clear consumer protection, we will be able to strengthen consumer confidence in the internal market and more generally towards the European Union.
It is good to briefly remind ourselves today what this original mandate involved.
It is a nonsense where science is concerned, because it holds back and penalises research, and it is a nonsense where medical progress is concerned, because the scientists who resort to animal experimentation are working daily to find medicines and treatments that tomorrow will cure new pandemics.
Let us clarify matters: there was no objection to paragraph 47 being inserted after paragraph 49.
The CDA is opposed to the proposal to reverse the burden of proof.

We now know that this is a very sensitive issue in the United Kingdom.
With regard to fiscal stimuli, during the course of the morning we have had a considerable debate.
Clear areas of responsibility must be defined.
The directive presses all the right buttons and goes some way towards addressing the problem.

Thus, I should like to ask President Barroso the following: is the reintroduction of Greece's own currency, the drachma, and also Ireland's, not the only long-term solution that will get us out of these problems?

To this must be added the question of Transnistria, which could cause some kind of instability.
Mrs Clinton, too, in her letter acknowledged that Parliament had a point, but neither of these documents went further and gave us a blueprint for solving this problem, and that is why a 'no' will, in our view, push towards a better agreement for the whole Parliament.
I would like to read you what he wrote to us today in an e-mail:
While it is not possible to restrict creativity, it is possible to negatively influence people's willingness to create.

If the current nuclear power plant projects in Kaliningrad and Astravo on the EU border are implemented without complying with the highest international safety requirements, they will pose a threat not just to the neighbouring Baltic countries but to the whole of Europe, which is relatively near.
(Standing ovation)
We have had our battles along the way, but most of the time we have fought together in the spirit of cooperation which pervades work in the Committee on Budgets.

on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, no one will disagree that terrorism needs to be prevented and that suspects need to be tried and held accountable, brought to justice in a fair trial, but in the so-called war on terror, we risk compromising precisely those freedoms and values that we claim to defend against destruction through terrorism.

Finally, the fact that the trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, which are undoubtedly very complex, have broken down also offers the European Union various opportunities to integrate more innovative elements into bilateral agreements and to try to construct new types of trade agreements which further integrate the EU's objectives with regard to the environment, climate, human rights or social rights.
It is more important than ever that we, the European Union, apply ourselves to our relations with Iraq and discuss this issue with our colleagues in the Iraqi Parliament, particularly the need to abolish the death penalty.

This is why the most important aspect of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament is probably the call to the UN to rethink the mandate of MINUSTAH in Haiti as a result of the epidemic and tensions caused by the recent, fiercely fought national elections, whose integrity is being seriously questioned by the international community.
I call urgently for it to be supported.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this debate.
I would endorse everything said by the authors of the questions and I am truly grateful for their valuable contributions.

The Belgian Presidency made a major contribution to the launch of this new process of economic governance and we now have to continue the excellent work it started.
I would also like to thank the Member States, who have been very constructive in this area.
To me, that seems particularly relevant right now, as we have already witnessed, or can begin to see, the signs of the first crisis of European democracy.

What we believe is important is that those public services work in the framework of a strong single market in respect of Community rules.
The Europe 2020 strategy, which lays out the EU's detailed plans for growth and jobs for the next decade, lays special emphasis on young people and sets clear targets for educational attainment.
This view is shared by the European Data Protection Supervisor.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk at the same time about accession to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and about accession to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The debt crisis in the euro area has proven the need to establish an economic union and economic governance as quickly as possible.
It is not I who decides who must support me.
In a tough economic climate, it is not right that the European Parliament should be planning to increase its expenditure by 2.3% next year.
Therefore, this is definitely something that we must take seriously in an increasingly global economy such as our own.
It might sound a bit complicated, but it is actually a very efficient tool.
I urge the other parliamentary groups and, above all, the EU Member States, which will actually decide the matter, to demand the same.
A future revision of payment systems and the creation of a European public agency are still to be dealt with.
The reasons are that no real savings have been made on any budget line, that expenditure has often just been postponed to 2013, that our requested reduction of travelling costs will most probably fail, and that the negotiating procedure for this report was not transparent and aimed to exclude smaller groups with more critical views on the proposed budget increases.
in writing. - I voted for this report on the basis of expert reports which say that at this moment, both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner.
in writing. - The approval and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon have meant increased responsibility for Parliament, with the administrative burden that that entails.
It is a fact that violations of human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law have become commonplace in Russia.
In a word, and this is the only solution, everything must be done to reverse the immigration flows, to dissuade those who are tempted to leave their country, to promote development and ensure that families are reunited only in the countries of origin.
Croatia had problems with its neighbours, including Slovenia, but Croatia worked to solve the problems.
Communication of Council common positions: see Minutes
That is why we have to make sure there are positive outcomes from the G20 Employment Ministers' meeting, the first to be called, as has just been mentioned.
The horrendous financial crisis in Greece and the financial imbalance in other Member States have highlighted the need for politically directed European economic governance.
For the time being its popularity lags behind the international ISO 14001 Standard.
We need more integration of our social and economic and climate and energy policies, with the objective of job retention and creation with decent living and working conditions.
Therefore, the taxpayers, who will also have to pay for this crisis, definitely have the right to be guaranteed at least three things: firstly, greater transparency regarding the decisions to close airports and how the situation is developing.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Hahn for this work.
Immigration has more than one name, because my esteemed fellow Members have spoken today about immigration from Africa, which mainly affects the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, and what they said is, in a certain sense, justified.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Oettinger, like Fukushima, Chernobyl showed that, despite all the rules we may set down, the residual risk from human error needs to be measured and that, in this context, we must identify more clearly where the limits of nuclear energy lie, because obviously even the strictest regulations cannot eliminate this residual risk as a result of human error.
This I think will ultimately lead us to mistakenly believe that we can do without European farmers, and maybe just import food from outside of the EU.
However, it is important to note the dangers involved in 'soft law' approaches to labour standards.
We, as Europe, champion a move from an oil-based economy and we champion renewables.
Last summer, as well as the fires, there were other disasters, the most recent of which occurred only last weekend in the south of Italy.
I also hope that we will be able to affirm the environmental dimension of that approach, not just the social one.
Linguistic genocide was defined - Article 3(1) - in 1948 as the ban on a group being able to use its language in everyday contact or at school, or on books being published and publications being distributed in the group's language.
By amending the constitution in that way, without really involving other parties or civil society organisations, it is undermining the democratic process, killing off dynamism and threatening to impose the exclusive right of a single party.
However, the European Union is the greatest importer of fish products from other parts of the world.
The Commission's initiative was, therefore, fully deserving of support, even with the adoption of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs, for there is no point in maintaining complicated reporting requirements in the case of small enterprises.
I would like to point out that the lack of participation of the United States in the ICC is the single most important factor reducing the relevance and authority of the ICC.
The future regulation should be stimulating and enhancing the industry instead of limiting it.
The vote on the Framework Agreement will take place punctually at 12.00, then there will be a break until 13.30, and then we will proceed to the vote on the College of Commissioners - that is today's order of business.
Firstly, I would like to say how much I welcome the fact that the report discusses the need for greater synergy between two key pillars of European policy, namely, development and security.
In the long term, we can only limit our dependence if agricultural policy focuses more on regional business cycles with sustainable production, short transport paths and a high proportion of self-marketing.
It is a strategic precondition for the genuine establishment of a Single European Sky.
It calls for the creation of a coordinating body, to be responsible for improving cooperation between the Member States in the implementation of social rules, as well as the setting up of inspection bodies.
I am voting against this report.
In 2008, 116 million European citizens were exposed to the risk of poverty and social exclusion.
Cars are being rendered unaffordable, as people should be taking the bus.
The EU cofinanced EUR 150 million in 2008, and allocated EUR 120 million in 2009 and EUR 100 million for the following years.
It is time we stopped this unhealthy circus.
The second factor is privatisation.
While securing sustainable food supply is one of our greatest challenges, the EU is one of the greatest success stories of recent times, having brought peace, stability and prosperity to the region.
I hope that in future, we can invest in ensuring that those who produce creative work are properly remunerated for it and that piracy does not endanger their livelihood, as is common at present on the internet when files are downloaded illegally.
We Europeans are the ones who stand to gain from multilateralism working, but multilateralism will not work if emerging countries are involved only to a limited extent, at the G20 or elsewhere.
It is those people who badly need ICT tools who, because they have never used those tools in their lives before, are not used to utilising them.
There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system.
As far as public access to information about pharmaceuticals is concerned, it would seem that the situation varies across the European Union.
Therefore, I would ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps integrate electromobility further in the follow-on from Cars 21.
I believe that the new Parliament will not delay its response, which we expect to receive in February.
For their part, commitments undertaken in national plans should be made known to the international community, thus guaranteeing greater transparency over all processes.
The national authorities also need to get to work on the loan application to the European Investment Bank, so that adequate sums can be granted for fast and sustainable reconstruction in this region.
I also find it somewhat surprising that, in the midst of an economic crisis with rising unemployment, in which the effects of globalisation can be felt, the EGF has received and accepted so few applications from the Member States.
Mr Oettinger, you are in the process of drawing up the Energy Roadmap 2050.
I would like to inform you that following the statements from the representatives of the political groups, I will inform you of the technical arrangements concerning voting on this report.
In view of this, I voted in favour of this report on the amendment to Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common register for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals who participate in any way in the drafting and implementation of EU policies.
On policing, the EUPOL mission of the Council is doing the mentoring and training on the ground, whilst the Commission supports the Afghan national police through the Law and Order Trust Fund (LOTFA).
The euro has provided stability and the conditions for creating millions of new jobs, and that must not be forgotten in these days when everyone is talking of a crisis.
We are living in unprecedented times.
We believe that this requirement will not bring proven security benefits and will be a barrier to smooth trade.
We are returning to nationalism and protectionism, which have been consistently rejected for 50 years, ever since the Community was first founded.
The accession negotiations with Croatia have, until recently, been going well.
This legal act must come into force as soon as possible.
We are going to do exactly the opposite.
I urge Mrs Wallström, who is a great champion of minorities, to mention to President Barroso to keep his promise that the prospective commissioner for fundamental rights will deal with minorities' rights, including those of indigenous minorities, such as the Sami, and those of immigrant minorities and the Roma.
If we take a look around the world at how the other large regions operate, conclude agreements and view their partners from a strategic point of view, we can certainly see that they are all moving quicker and quicker.
These materials must be prepared according to the current stringent regulations for protecting human health and the environment.
Different approaches and solutions must be tried and should be discussed by Parliament as a matter of urgency, something that has not happened so far.
This accession will actually provide citizens with a new means of recourse: they will now be able to refer a case to the European Court of Human Rights if their fundamental rights are infringed by an EU Institution or a Member State on account of an action or failure to act on their part.
This decision is wise and right.
The cultural sector is a growth sector that is developing faster than many other areas in the economy.
We are not threatening to do this, but the option remains open to us.
The talks also have fundamental significance for the restoration of funds to the country, which had payments of over EUR 600 million in EU development aid suspended.
Pursuant to Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure, a list will be drawn up of 30 speakers, who will be chosen selectively so as to maintain a representative political and geographical balance.
We know that there are increasing amounts of counterfeit or falsified medicinal products in circulation, with the figures running into the millions.
The donor conference in New York a fortnight ago raised EUR 7 billion or, at least, that was the amount which was pledged.
It is quite simply necessary to have these bilateral agreements, and therefore I welcome them.
The more the information exchanges take place upstream, the more it will be possible to prevent the risk of nontransposition or incorrect transposition.
I would also like this time, as on the occasion of the Strasbourg part-session held from 2 to 5 February, to reaffirm my opposition to the resolution on the alleged CIA activities involving the transportation and illegal detention of alleged terrorists on the territory of certain European countries.
We are facing at least three parallel crises today - the financial crisis, the climate crisis and what I would call the ecosystem crisis, or overuse of natural resources.
We need data, but we are aware that the data on ethnic origin are always sensitive, and we must be cautious when requesting and handling them.
(HU) Madam President, we have witnessed an unprecedented event here, in the European Parliament.
How can one fail to be delighted that, on the two issues of major concern to Europeans - the crisis and climate change - Europe is finally on the front line?
It also contains one quarter of the world's population.
We cannot really be saying that we want to preach one thing and do another.
This policy became more integrated into EU foreign policy.
Free trade is good!
In that respect, it is enough to look at what kind of neighbourly relations Turkey maintains with other EU Member States such as Greece, Cyprus or with a country outside the EU like Armenia.
Patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (debate)
Let us rationalise the European defence market.
The use of innovative solutions should result in lower costs for enterprises and should enable consumers to enjoy cheaper and better products.
We have to be careful when discussing the issue of access to documentation and transparency that we do not go overboard, and that we do not expose documentation and procedures to a degree which makes the entire system unfeasible.
Personally, I am prepared to see a trade-off.
The professionals need to be given the necessary resources to be able to develop innovative mechanisms for measuring the weather, winds and temperatures so that they can work under the necessary conditions, because ultimately they are protecting us all.
The Commission has already opened calls for proposals - in the INTERREG, CIP and FP7 programmes - to support the establishment of networks of public authorities on pre-commercial procurement.
Better regulation of European political parties, and their associated political foundations, will also bring benefits in terms of transparency.
Within the light of the responses to this consultation, the Commission issued an action plan in 2003, proposing, inter alia, the elaboration of a common frame of reference and containing definitions, common principles and model rules, with a view to improving the quality and coherence of European contract law.
Moreover, I consider it fitting that the European Ministers of Energy have decided to give priority to safety in European nuclear plants, emphasising the importance of greater European coordination during the modernisation of nuclear facilities.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case.
Such an agreement is expected to be capable of generating a consumer surplus (benefits in terms of lower fares) of up to EUR 460 million.
We should not forget, however, that they merely permit the technical, substantive preparation of a political decision.
This is a very real problem in all Member States, and I would emphasise again that it concerns not only our regulations, but also national regulations that involve European funds.
The key is clearly that the mechanism is crafted so that it can, in future, be fully incorporated into the Union system.
We must not allow ourselves to be provoked.
It means lower energy bills, not higher ones, and it improves energy security.
The Treaty of Lisbon defines precisely that the Union shall have competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States.
In my own nation, for example, our budget contributions will rise by 60% over the next 12 months.
The registration of lobbyists is a big issue and lobbying is a big issue, and we need to push on, use this as an experiment and hopefully, in the future, make it compulsory and mandatory.
I would also like to add that I do not know who talks to which members of the public in the EU.
But in Europe, we must obviously first create some common approach to the methodology of possible assessment of risk.
Please make a distinction between Mr Oettinger, the former Christian Democrat, and Commissioner Oettinger.
In 2008, the Commission tabled a draft Council regulation on the conservation of fish stocks through technical measures, which aimed to replace a previous regulation.
As has been mentioned, over 100 000 flights were cancelled, tens of millions of business and holiday passengers were not able to travel as planned, goods and cargo were delayed or not transported at all, businesses were affected and our European carriers and airports suffered catastrophic financial losses.
I also believe that this macro-economic assistance will have a positive effect on Georgia's relations with Member States, in addition to the critical role it will play in the country's government properly applying reforms.
I voted in favour of this report because, as the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, the European Union must pay greater attention to humanitarian aid in those areas where it is needed as a matter of urgency, given that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of natural disasters and internal conflicts.
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous impact assessment structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament's committees should use to create more synergies.
I am pleased that you said today that you want to meet almost on a monthly basis, because it is your job to bring the Heads of State or Government and the Member States back to Europe.
The Commission has received replies from the 27 Member States and a document presenting these replies will be published in the next six months.
However, the arbitrary creation of new projects and organisations to facilitate these goals runs counter to the budgetary realities evident across the EU.
We therefore voted against the compromise in today's vote.
I think it is also absolutely right that you raise the importance of being visible on the ground.
Persons managing cities have a particular responsibility.
The Committee members were of the opinion that such a ban would be unworkable.
I gave my vote of confidence to this team of Commissioners, which will be led by José Manuel Barroso, as in general, they have shown good technical preparation, seriousness and ambition to be able to respond to the challenges of the EU without forgetting the values which underpin its creation, namely solidarity and territorial cohesion.
And there has been, for a long time now, one single loser: Europe.
According to official statistics, the Russian economy is growing at a rate of 4%, despite the economic climate, and this is forecast to continue for a long time.
All that remains now is to conclude the climate conference in Copenhagen - the last and most important task, with the greatest long-term impact.
The Republic of Moldova is a European country through its history and geography.
As regards the accusation of the unlawfulness of my action, I would just point out that there may have been various attempts to criminalise me, but never any criminal investigations, not because the Austrian judges or public prosecutors were prejudiced but because they saw how unfounded those allegations were.
Some of these proposals have, I might add, already materialised, or are in the process of doing so.
The Czech presidency will follow the matter and will take any further necessary steps on behalf of the EU, if appropriate, and will continue to raise this issue in our contacts with the authorities in Minsk.
This could help to reverse the trend of the decreasing number of consumers being protected when going on holiday.
I think that in spite of the exceptional situation, decisions which are important for the European Union should be made calmly and with respect for the principle of solidarity and the equal rights of all Member States.
(SV) Like many countries, Sweden, where I come from, is heavily dependent on the car industry.
This especially applies to the skilled trades, for which there is no uniform standard across Europe against which qualifications can be measured.
We want to see the list of regulations and internal statutes that Member States want to retain.
The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy.
I strongly condemn the practice of violence against women, and also children, in the recent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, and I would like to call for the most appropriate measures to be taken to protect their most fundamental rights and dignity.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission would support a postponement of the vote.
There are many petitions on this.
Finally, in order to avoid distortions of competition, it is essential that a fund from a third country operating within the European Union benefits from the passport and may carry on business if it respects the same conditions as EU funds.
Their role is becoming clearer by the day.
The Vice President of the Commission knows that there are several other third countries that are still not honouring the principle of reciprocity with regard to all the Member States of the European Union.
Voting time
However, we cannot blame workers, smallholders or entrepreneurs for this situation.
We do not have money to give away.
Not everywhere can people speak freely or make known their opinion.
It should be possible to reduce the current 60 blocks and control centres to between 15 and 20.
It is also made clear that innovation and research are two sides of the same coin.
These exemptions will help the outermost regions.
Let me now say a few words on the EU guidelines.
I am delighted with the compromise reached on this regulation in the course of the negotiations between the three institutions and, obviously, I too welcome the spirit of cooperation and the will for compromise that prevailed in the three institutions throughout the entire negotiations.
In these difficult economic times, we cannot afford to overlook the potential of this agreement for our two regions in terms of jobs and growth.
Europe could, instead, position itself very well to use culture in external action as a two-way street, whereby we teach but also learn, and whereby we maintain fruitful dialogue with other great regional blocs such as Mercosur or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
That is why I remain convinced that, by engaging with Turkmenistan, we will be in a better position to put forward our arguments in favour of a more open society in that country.
Also, the 12-point EU action plan on MDGs proposed by the Commission is reflected rightly.
It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors, and that this drives some vile criminal activities.
The aim is also to increase flexibility, to reform, as you will argue, the labour markets - in other words, to clearly create flexisecurity without the security.
An EU-backed report has recently concluded that up to 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty.
The Commission's emergency humanitarian response system was launched simultaneously in Brussels and in ECHO's Managua regional office covering Latin America.
It does not address the main concern which is to ensure that Europe has a strong defence and cooperates with NATO, but is not subservient to it.
In fact, Article 182 of the Treaty of Lisbon ensures a suitable legal basis for future developments in this area.
(Applause)
One of these is the proposal for a uniform EU foreign policy.
A case in point is the common agricultural policy.
We need better control of our external borders, we need more security, we need biometric data, and we need alerts to be interlinked.
Those in need of credit are the ones who suffer with a new tax.
Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable.
In the current situation, I support the promotion and extension of the Erasmus programmes for young entrepreneurs and for trainees.
The report calls for the strengthening of basic employment standards, which are enshrined in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in the workplace and the abolition of child labour.
Its global image has been influenced by overpopulation, poverty (80% of the Indian population live on less than USD 2 a day) and disease.
Commissioner, thank you for your information on the Commission's activities.
This is a strong message from Parliament that we need action.
Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.
This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact.
We must ensure that they have adequate product information etc. to be able to make wise and informed choices.
These views will be taken into account as far as possible, taking into account the realities and specificities of this particular negotiation.
In summary, every gesture and every action which increases the importance of human rights is significant, and we should talk openly about this, especially in the case of countries where basic human rights are violated.
This is incomprehensible!
We expect that Russian forces will be withdrawn from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and we expect that Russia will respect Georgia's right to consider and decide its own future.
I should like to mention the case of Turkey.
(EL) Madam President, I, too, should like to raise the issue of tar sands; this is an important issue, because it is the reason why a similar agreement which we already have with Canada, an international agreement on commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, is not being respected.
I firmly believe, Commissioner, that the European Parliament will be happy to help you in this task.
The introduction of these systems needs to be completed.
So far it has been the opposite of equality that the European Commission has been negotiating throughout the world.
Perhaps if we were to decide what to set aside for the deprived before production takes place, we would spend far less than if we purchased it on the market and we would achieve a policy for supporting certain markets in crisis, such as the milk market.
At the same time, Commissioner, we have a duty to inform everyone who chooses to holiday in a European country of the rights which they have had to date and, more importantly, to inform them of the loopholes and of the improvements we want to make.
Of course, analysts in the market are well able to read across from stress tests and other information and make an estimate as to what is going on in the banking books.
This proposal largely takes its inspiration from the European regulation on the CO2 emissions of cars, which has been in force since 2008.
Serbia has hidden potential which it needs to realise on its road to EU membership, and it must do so in its own interest and in the interests of its neighbours, the region as a whole and the European Union.
Even if I am very critical about the whole of the Union approach, I might very well agree with your 'whole-of-the-island' approach.
The European Commission has confirmed this, as indeed did we last week, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, without a single vote against.
For Belarus and also for Ukraine, Russia's autocratic system, which is characterised by a flexible approach to foreign policy and a tough approach to domestic policy, and by oppression and repression, is obviously more attractive and provides more guidance than what the EU has to offer.
In this Chamber we must state unequivocally that Belarusians have the same rights as the citizens of other free European countries, and this includes the right to demonstrate freely in Minsk today, on the 91st anniversary of Belarusian Independence.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
I would like to say that we would rather look to the present and the future than back to the past.
This new arrangement, which has my support, will make the programme more efficient and up to date both in terms of agricultural policy and from a social point of view.
In this context, my question is this: How can he have a positive view of the fact that in Canada, an area one eighth of the size of Austria is destroyed each year in connection with the exploitation of these tar sands and the entire livelihoods of the First Nations communities are being taken away?
President-in-Office of the Council. - We do not have access to this information formally but, via international organisations, NGOs, contacts, political parties and so on, we do get information - which is a bit fragmented - about the situation of the political prisoners.
You should also be exerting pressure on the blatant nuclear lobbyists from the United Kingdom, which brings us to the main topic.
This vote highlights that there is no equality between Member States and no solidarity within any political group.
Now there are new technologies to fundamentally improve transport safety (e.g. electronic stability control systems) or to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions (e.g. low rolling resistance tyres), if such technologies are fitted as standard in new motor vehicles.
It reflects a very old-fashioned socialist command-and-control approach to economic policy which is not relevant to solving the problems of the 21st century.
Similar restrictions also exist in terms of access to third-country tenders.
As a defender of civil rights, I am bound to be opposed to this decision.
The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe.
In conclusion, I can assure you that I am closely monitoring trends in food prices and I want to work in the future in consultation with you, here, in Parliament, and with the Council, on this issue, so as to come forward with concrete proposals, first and foremost with the reform of the common agricultural policy, but also with other, more specific, instruments.
This is what I would call back home one of the more classic European Parliament dossiers.
The European Partnership is not an attempt to gain control of this area, or to extend our sphere of influence.
An energy-efficient Europe is also a driving force of innovation, and the energy equivalent of fast trains, supergrids and high-tech smart grids is needed to improve Europe's competitiveness.
We voted in favour of this own-initiative report which highlights the aspect of gender in unstable employment, denounces various situations and insists upon a set of measures to combat discrimination against women.
Many of them apply for asylum in European countries.
Only then will I even consider voting in favour of even more anti-terrorism laws.
The EU's strategic backup for combating the forest fires proved, therefore, to be useful once again.
The figures show that it is a useful tool, with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed.
We should, for example, improve monitoring of the process whereby licences are granted for oil drilling or leasing installations to third parties.
I have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole, but I am very positively disposed towards some of the wordings in the proposal, which I have voted in favour of.
In some Member States, it is currently possible to buy one gigabyte for less than EUR 1.
However, past experience is less encouraging than was indicated yesterday by several Members during the debate.
In this regard, we wish to introduce some innovations, including business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts regulated by an optional instrument that would enlarge the parties' choice, and the introduction of a monitoring and review mechanism in order to ensure that the optional instrument keeps up with market needs and legal and economic developments.
I therefore supported this report.
This motion for a resolution is idle talk designed to make people forget that Parliament can only accept or reject.
There is really no reason to wait to proceed with the Commission.
The debate is closed.
He has very successfully included as part of the motion for a resolution the need for Member States to implement measures aimed at achieving territorial cohesion.
This Parliament even allocated EUR 5 million in this year's European Union budget so as to facilitate the implementation of this clause.
If the rapporteur were only to present the initiative report on Monday evening, he would have four minutes.
Nobody should be lost in a jungle of unclear charges and levies.
Innovation encourages the creation of synergies between traditional areas of activity and more innovative ones.
This does not mean that we do not respect the basic values of the EU, or we do not comply fully with the requirements set out in European law or international law.
Firstly, the primary and principal objective of structural policy must be to promote real convergence, by acting as an instrument of redistribution with regard to the costs, inequalities and asymmetries caused by the internal market, by Economic and Monetary Union and by the liberalisation of world trade, for those countries and regions in the European Union which are economically less developed.
This modern-day slavery is deeply rooted in poverty and exclusion and, therefore, the elimination of the unacceptable living conditions that many Roma face must be a major strategic objective.
I hope that this remains the case.
At present, Japan needs real aid.
This would offer an alternative source to that provided by the Nabucco project.
National management declarations should help us a great deal to see how EU money is used by national authorities and who is responsible for the use of this money.
In the context of south-east Europe, the definition of synergy is one where it represents the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member.
As for the financial aspect, I called for the initial proposal to be refocused.
Mr President, the Stockholm Programme is part of creating a common legal and judicial system across the European Union.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, if everything is straightforward, as some of the speakers here this afternoon appear to be saying, let the executive college ascertain whether the Hungarian text is compatible and legally compliant with the foundations of our EU platform, and things will be clear.
In addition, the report claims that European solidarity and economic development will be threatened by a reduction of the budget.
(PL) Mr President, in the second half of September this year, Russia and Belarus held military exercises codenamed 'West' 2009 and 'Lake Lagoda' 2009.
It is fortunate that my own country, Ireland, is a member of the euro zone as the current currency has been a source of stability for Ireland and other countries at a time of unprecedented turbulence and during the current global recession.
Concerning the investment facility managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is a risk-bearing instrument funded by the EDF to encourage private investment in the difficult economic and political context of the ACP countries, I have very mixed feelings about the idea that the EIB should present a report as part of the discharge procedure, but this will be a point for discussion, especially if, as Parliament hopes, the Union becomes a shareholder in the EIB.
Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2003/37/EC relating to agricultural and forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, apply to this directive.
On 11 March, Japan was hit by a massive earthquake, followed by a tsunami, that has caused the greatest nuclear crisis in the country's history, with the Fukushima nuclear plant suffering serious structural damage and having been in imminent danger since then of triggering a nuclear disaster of major proportions.
I am in agreement with the rapporteur.
We realise that another framework of compliance with international law is needed.
Mr President, I will quote John Stuart Mill and then I will continue in Swedish. 'If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.'
Such an outcome will be a very welcome development for EU performers.
Well, Innovation Union will make the best use of public money.
We would like to hear the speech of Commissioner Viviane Reding on these issues.
I would like to address a very clear message to the Commission.
We would like to see it.
I call on the Council and the Commission to make an unambiguous choice for the Nabucco project.
There seems to be a complete blindness on the part of the Commission with regard to the problems that exist in that area.
The earthquake, moreover, has struck the poorest country in the western hemisphere, where 80% of the population live below the poverty line and 54% live in absolute poverty.
I sincerely ask you to please support this compromise.
The Council of Europe is currently working on a new draft anti-discrimination regulation and I would like to highlight three aspects.
That is something we reject.
Finally, I hope that there will be an effort to try and deal with the delays.
The two were unrelated.
The relations between the EU and Ukraine have always been very close and based upon a constructive dialogue.

The document that has been approved today highlights the clear need for additional support by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in areas strategic to the recovery of the European economy: small and medium-sized enterprises, midcaps and infrastructure and other key growth- and employment-enhancing projects as part of the Europe 2020 strategy. The report urges the EIB to invest in freight transport in the European railway sector as well as in other Trans-European Networks of freight transport with a focus on the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea ports, in order to link them definitively to European markets.
Croatia seems to be prepared to move away from its past, for example by providing support for returning war refugees.

Mr President, we have received information that a boat from Libya carrying refugees has capsized in the Mediterranean.
You cannot complain about the European Parliament concerning itself with this matter and then be dissatisfied that nuclear technology is not safe enough.
In order to make that possible, we need to face the challenges of the digital age not only in the information and knowledge society, but also, above all, in the cultural and creative sector.
It is as simple as that.
Now you are presenting to us the College of Commissioners that best suits your programme.
It is, after all, thanks to their efforts that the compromise reached ultimately does what it is supposed to do, namely take away the prospect of work as an incentive for illegal immigration by actually penalising workers who are staying in the European Union illegally.

Secondly, I think that, as a Member State of the European Union, Greece must understand the European models for reconciling with history and make every effort to ensure that the dispute over the name of Macedonia does not present an obstacle to this country's progress towards Europe, because any other attitude is contrary to the spirit and destiny of Europe.

Perhaps the next such report could go into more detail on this matter.

As four years have passed since Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 came into force, and as the Commission has already announced the tabling of proposals relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2013 period, there is a need for a brief analysis of the results achieved since then and of future means of development.

However, in the case of PVC in particular, I think it will be necessary to take a very sensitive approach to finding the right compromise between the objective requirements of environmental protection and the interests of the manufacturing sector.
It is, at the very least, insulting for the political powers of the 'one-way street' in Europe who voted in the European Parliament for the directive providing, apart from anything else, for the detention of 'illegal' immigrants for a full 18 months, to express in this report their alleged regret about their inhumane conditions of detention and to call for them not to be detained.
In terms of this financial instrument, it is possible to render financial aid to ACP countries (African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States) in restructuring the manufacturing of sugar, and financial support for five programmes is envisioned: food security; environment and sustainable development of natural resources, including energy; migration and asylum granting; investment in human resources; the role of local authorities and non-governmental organisations in development processes.

The most recent expression of this offensive is the unlawful intervention in Portugal by the 'troika' of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
The obligation of employers to carry out advance supervision by checking workers' residence status is valuable in that it grants a competency to the private sector; something that the European Union has not often tried.
In this case, the Council and, above all, this Parliament are also involved in making the decision about the composition of the College and about the portfolios which you will make available and about the programme for the next five years that you will present.
The zones of convergence are most exposed to the risk of being hit by natural disasters.
This aims to remove the current physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and alleviate the 'border effect' between territories and regions, permitting them to address their shared challenges together, whether these be territorial, global, economic or societal.
Now that it is bankrupt, and sadly so, the Icelandic Government is, of course, in the queue to join.
Ireland must remain a nuclear-free island.
author. - Mr President, the ECON Committee has put forward this question and resolution because some careful thinking has to be done.
This was a huge task and she has done very well.
Paternity leave not only sends an important signal that children are the responsibility of both parents, but also has other positive consequences.
The debate on violations of human rights and democratic standards should therefore cover the entire region of the South Caucasus.
The external dimension of the social policy is aimed at promoting core social standards in third countries in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations and to ensure that workers are protected through compliance with international labour standards.
I have supported the text tabled as it facilitates the creation of the mechanism and its combined procedure.
However, despite its ambition, the last climate conference in Copenhagen was a failure for all those who were determined to reach a binding agreement.
National disasters and calamities must be a priority and I hope that in the future, the European Commission will take prompter, more immediate action.
The EIB has focused on three areas which the crisis in Europe has hit hardest, namely: SMEs, convergence regions and climate action.
In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that these critical remarks are not in any way directed against Russia or its people, but the opposite - they are directed against the current government, in order to improve the situation in Russia and make our cooperation more fruitful.
Rest assured that we shall also miss you for your work and dedication.
The Commission, let us recall, failed to get its way in the 2005 Regulation.
To this purpose, it is not the intention of the Commission to propose a one-size-fits-all solution; on the contrary, we would like to develop a toolbox, including short- and medium-term practical actions, in order to provide cities with the tools to address, in an integrated way, specific issues related to urban mobility.
In this connection, I would stress in particular the importance of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector and the innovations that come from this, as it can be truly inventive.
The EU is prepared to strengthen international cooperation in this area both in the context of the next NPT Review Conference and also in other forums.
Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: Czech Republic - UNILEVER (
I congratulate both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for speaking so clearly and for stressing the need for actual improvement.
The previous speaker reminded us of all those who contributed to this, of the milestones, of the European monetary system, which was an agreement with the European Central Bank to create central rates, of the Delors report, which provided for the introduction of the monetary union in three stages, of the Treaty of Maastricht - only two years after the fall of the Wall - and of the transitional periods.
This text has the merit of proposing solutions for radically rethinking this policy.
We believe that negotiations should be reopened for the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which affects 700 million people and will be the most ambitious bi-regional agreement in the world.
In line with this approach, the Council confirmed its commitment to protecting those who are most vulnerable in its conclusions on the situation of the girl child, which the Council adopted last year.
Digitisation should increase the access of the general public to materials that are essential for study, cognition and education, and strengthening cultural identity.
For me, the direction is clear: I want a Europe which is open, inclusive and green.
The resolution calls for new measures to be found to help Belarusian civil society and the opposition, and this is only fair.
The inclusion of the European Development Fund (EDF) in the budget would be significant progress as long as it does not lead to a reduction in total funding amounts at EU level.
The current proposal is a breakthrough because it puts victims first and tackles the problem in a complex, cross-border manner.
Therefore, I supported today's proposals.
(Applause)
We have a wonderful climate, our land is our asset, our forests burned as have the forests in California, they have held Olympic Games, as have we, and we have ended up with the same problems as California.
There are various reasons for this, but I think that we must give local authorities an important role in this to encourage them to develop public-private partnerships.
(SK) I congratulate the authors on the submitted question and you, Commissioner, on your response.
If coal could no longer be mined in Europe, we would have to import it from the United States or Australia.
So that is not the solution to the Greek problem.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, we in the ECR Group want to see more effective control of the EU budget.
The new Hungarian constitution is a European constitution in spirit, born in the spirit of ensuring all fundamental human rights to its citizens, and of cooperation and unity of nations.
It is also very important that both parents participate in a child's life from the very first months.
There is one thing I am sure of, however, and that is that your party is a right-wing extremist, neo-fascist party.
I think it is also important to point to the fact that, during this Presidency and while we are standing here, the European Union is, for the first time, a leading global actor in one of the most important international issues mankind is facing. This is new and it gives great responsibilities for the future because it is obvious that, whatever is achieved in Copenhagen, the European Union has been playing a fundamental and crucial role in setting the agenda for the things that we should achieve.
We should work towards achieving three things.
(PL) Madam President, talks are being held between the European Union and Russia on the future of the energy sector, but from what I understand, a new group is currently being set up, which will debate the third energy package in the context of gas security.
We have been elected to provide an answer to that.
I understand now from the United Kingdom that there are real concerns about this.
in writing. - Mr Draghi should be congratulated on his appointment, and I believe he is a very able candidate.
It is an official act requested first by the Conference of Presidents and then by all of Parliament.
Unfortunately, this is so only in theory, because Slovakia is in contempt of the principles of the EU every day.
After these opening remarks, I have three comments to make.
We are opposed to this.
It is a well known fact, of course, that demons always awaken further demons.
First of all we must intervene with all the vigour we can muster, and with all the help that we can offer in order to improve the democratic environment in these countries, and to strengthen democratic institutions in particular.
That is the truth, and it is not true to say it was a reduction in the working day - with the proposal from the Commission and the Council working hours totalled 78 per week - because there were to be 60 and 65 hours calculated over three months.
So we have the mechanism, we have the means, and we are ready to use them if it comes to it.
For this reason, I believe that a common approach should be considered.
Second, concerning the review pursuant to Article 19, the Commission intends to undertake, no later than three years after the entry into force of this directive, an impact assessment focusing on the changes in scope.
It strengthens competition and users' rights, and it is important to emphasise this because I think it is something that often gets forgotten in the debate.
In the case of EU-Russia relations, I welcome the achievements already made in respect of not just a common economic and cooperative space, but also of shared values.
Instead, it is one of the major blocks to progress.
That is why it is important that the Council and the Commission undertake a careful analysis of this issue.
I will respond simultaneously to the Members of Parliament because a number of your questions converged.
Would that help Greece or Europe?
I would therefore like to ask a question: how can we protect our small and medium-sized enterprises from bankruptcy, and how can we protect our small farms from competition from China, India or Brazil?
Adoption of the Treaty means a new phase and an opportunity for the EU to make a step forward.
I firmly believe that we will be able to overcome this challenge, too, and I hope that we will be able to use this period of crisis to improve our approach to development.
We must seize every opportunity to encourage employment and social cohesion.
Change is essential.
A Europe that belongs to its citizens can only work as a Europe of homelands, subsidiarity and national sovereignty.
Amendment 52 of the report undermines the guarantee of freedom for religious communities themselves in Member States.
Excellence is the key word.
(PL) Mr President, Egypt is an important economic and commercial partner of the European Union.
I believe that we will also need to learn to discuss these matters with our partners, not only in forums dedicated to human rights, such as sub-committees, but also at the highest political level.
(DE) Thank you, Mr President, I very much welcome this proposal.
Repeal of Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas (
We are all aware that undeclared work is the main attraction for the thousands of men and women who cross our borders every day in search of a decent job and a way to feed their families.
And the citizens' initiatives?
Indeed, evidence shows that particular groups, and notably those under temporary or precarious contracts, have taken a much bigger hit as a result of the crisis.
We Europeans must finally seriously come to terms with our shared responsibility for these grave violations of human rights.
Mr President, the package has been a very difficult one for Parliament and the Council.
The Portuguese language - the third most important European language of universal communication - will suffer inexplicable discrimination with the introduction of this 'enhanced cooperation'.
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes
(CS) Madam President, I hope there is no one here from the countries of the Eastern Partnership, as they might think, on the basis of our numbers here, that we are not interested in the Eastern Partnership.
I do not mention this by chance.
European Economic Recovery Plan (
These, I believe, are three important principles.
However, those being crucified on the euro are not pigs but people, scourged by utopian one-size-fits-all dogma.
Since 2002, more than EUR 124 million has been allocated to these efforts.
In other words, it is a form of direct democracy which complements parliamentary representation.
We should stand with workers in China.
The result of all this work was the unanimous backing that this report received in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
The Commission's analysis of these agreements is always in terms of millions of euros earned by economic groups and multinationals.
It is an irresponsible mistake to spend public money to maintain this fleet.
Pressure and coercion by the EU to accept the timetables and the content of the agreements, with separate agreements and different terms for each country.
The scientific reports concerning the current biomass of bluefin tuna are alarmist: uncontrolled industrial-scale fishing has severely eroded stocks.
That is a fact and we must resolve these double standards.
Nothing is closed from this point of view.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The Rome I Regulation currently in force is an adequate regulatory instrument, which provides for a high level of protection of the weaker contractual party.
I am voting in favour of this report in the hope of finally witnessing the decommissioning of the Kozloduy reactors.
The progress achieved over recent years in the equality sector by the European Union is in danger of slowing down, or even of reversing, as a result of the current recession.
Can the Commission answer the following questions:
The sanctions which should be imposed on Lukashenko's regime should be harsh, for among other reasons, that it is a country which is an immediate neighbour of Europe.
The flagship initiative 'Platform against Poverty' stresses that steps taken with a view to reducing poverty must also take into account the differences between the situation of women and men.
Election of Quaestors of the European Parliament (deadline for submitting nominations): see Minutes
Europe has had a strategy for energy and combating climate change since 2008.
It is for this reason that we need jointly to get our systems in order and share intelligence in order to attack this issue.
So that this can indeed be done, I call on the Council, the Commission and you, ladies and gentlemen, to take steps to ensure that European consumers can no longer be misled in this way.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is the second time that we have had to increase the guarantee provided by the European Union to overcome the difficulties of its members, non-members of the euro zone.
There are what are called vertical funds, which have been mentioned and which are used to fight major diseases, such as Aids, malaria and tuberculosis, for example.
(Applause)
The truth is somewhere in between.
The Council is a budgetary authority, and we also note that we have many problems in the Member States.
Using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers, they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people, but I think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true, then most probably it is.
The German Institute for European Affairs (INEA), a research institute, recently carried out a study on this at the request of FIFA and found that six-plus-five is indeed acceptable and compatible with European law.
If we persist in making unilateral requests that Europe should reduce its emissions by much greater amounts than those provided for by the Kyoto Protocol, then the next summit in Cancún - the COP16 - will also be a failure and, once again, Parliament will look terrible.
there should be enhanced EU involvement in the Black Sea region and an ambitious Eastern Partnership.
It also means that, if they were professional, well educated and knew where they were going, we would not have to be afraid of overcharging.
The findings and recommendations of this report also show the potential for great benefits for consumers.
(NL) This report is one-sided.
Madam President, this moment has been a long time coming.
So how can the solution to the budget problems suddenly be to restrict flexibility?
To feel the solidarity of the institutions when you are on the frontline fighting a phenomenon such as the mafia in Italy, which has resulted in many victims over many years, is really important in my view, and I offer my heartfelt thanks.
In a resolution adopted in the plenary of 8 May 2008, Parliament welcomed the proposal and called for an interinstitutional agreement on the establishment of a common register between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, when Senator Obama became President Obama, we all heaved a sigh of relief.
Credit Rating Agencies - Reporting and documentation requirements in the case of merger and divisions - Insurance and reinsurance (Solvency II) (recast) (debate)
The third section is devoted to the impact assessments carried out by the European Parliament, which its committees are invited to use more extensively in order to further improve law making.
With regard to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we need an economic agenda which can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real, market-driven, economic development.
Since we apparently all agree that it is very good that there are reforms, we also need to support those reforms.
One cannot but worry about the pathetic prudential regulations to which they are subject, even in Europe.
This creates an imbalance that greatly affects both manufacturers and consumers on our continent, leading to anomalies that must be corrected.
For these reasons, we voted against this report.
One amendment points out the difficulty of putting all administrative expenditure under heading 5; another amendment calls for the early publication of the guidelines and estimates to ensure we can make our decisions in a proper and timely way.
Mr President, allow me to start by telling you that I hope, as I believe do all my fellow Members and the President of the Commission, that the system that we have put in place will work.
In the end, this is what the principle of 'ownership' means.
Mr President, Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union states that verification, in accordance with evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by the new Member States is an essential requirement for the Council to decide to abolish internal border controls with those States.
Mr Chair, will you take a blue card question?
The proposal put forward by Monaco to include bluefin tuna in Appendix 1 of CITES may prove to be beneficial, given that this species is condemned to extinction unless urgent drastic measures are taken to protect it.
(Applause)
The report contains valuable proposals on what has to be done in order to make more efficient and effective use of natural resources, in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and save energy.
We want an effective Commission, with powers distributed more evenly than was the case in the past and, in this context, we are also counting on the promise that you made to our group, namely that a particular commissioner from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with responsibility for fundamental rights and civil liberties, will be given a place in your team.
In some countries, including Romania, in years affected by drought - which have been growing in number - there is a fall in the production of hydroelectric and nuclear energy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I read the first proposal from the Commission, I was very sceptical about the way it dealt with this matter.
This report stresses the need to develop European-level cooperation in the field of vocational education and training to increase transparency and for ease of comparison between the various education systems.
Firstly the communication identifies how good governance in the tax area could be improved within the European Union so as to reinforce the argument for other jurisdictions to follow.
They are also more creative and have broader horizons.
Particularly in the field of foreign, security and defence policy, transferring this sovereignty to a supranational institution is a brave and also a difficult move.
You cannot combat terrorism with anti-terror laws that create the same feelings of insecurity.
It all went very fast, from the time we started discussing it to today, so we now have agreement before the election.
I would also stress the call for the Commission to table a legislative proposal on guaranteeing access to certain basic banking services by June 2011 and to improve the transparency and comparability of bank charges by the end of 2011, as well as the call to table a legislative proposal to remove obstacles encountered by mobile workers in order to ensure the full portability of pension rights.
The agreement was initialled on 15 October 2009.
We cannot have a 'do-nothing' attitude, although I note that this phrase has become synonymous with the Conservatives over recent months.
In a context of budgetary restrictions - which rules out public money as a solution - and increased global competition, Europe must react in order to get itself back into the innovation race.
I would say that we need to discuss the 2020 strategy, but we need even more a 2010 strategy, describing the action that needs to be taken now in order to restore growth, reduce deficits and create optimism.
In so doing, care should be taken over safety.
The programme as it emerges from the European Council needs to lay out the guiding priorities for justice and home affairs in the years to come and to show how they will be put into practice.
Parliament is ready to support the development of a CSDP that is fully integrated with the Union's external action and is rooted in the values and principles of Europe.
I believe this is great news, I think it is appropriate and right to congratulate the Commission, Mr Šefčovič and the Spanish Presidency for the boost they have given to this initiative and for agreeing to submit a very important proposal to this House.
Mr Tony Blair is a war criminal.
Following the stalling of the Doha Round multilateral trade negotiations last summer and the agreements reached by the Group of Twenty at the Washington summit last November, does the Council feel that there are grounds for the European Union making new proposals on trade that would satisfy developing countries?
These amendments, if passed, will restore some sort of balance between end users' rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of others, including the right to intellectual property protection and indeed the right to privacy.
This can be seen in the Monti report in the area of essential measures for the single market.
At the end of 2010, with a budget contribution of some EUR 390 million and an EIB capital allocation of some EUR 700 million, we were actually able to lend more than EUR 6 billion, which financed more than EUR 16 billion of investment in research.
This, however, is probably not the key argument, here.
We had a full day of talks yesterday with the foreign ministers of Slovenia and Croatia, as well as of the trio countries.
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting
I prefer to take something from it that I feel to be very valuable: the fact that it has provided us with a great potential that we will be able to draw on in the coming months.
There is a clear understanding and recognition internationally to place agriculture and rural development higher on the policy agenda at national, regional and possibly at continental level.
As I see it, consistency also means adapting the existing rules to reality.
That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost.
The High Representative is responsible for proposing a concept for the service, not the Council bureaucracy.
We will be the area, the continent with the greatest number of people over 65, and this will result in a decline in our capacity to produce, a decline in the active population and in labour capacity, and this will put pressure on our social protection systems.
And, on that matter, because I do not think this will come too soon, I really wish the Commission to fail in the negotiations on the readmission agreement.
The package, which is still to be approved by the Ecofin Council on 19 November, amounts to EUR 280 million and will be provided in the form of a financial envelope to Member States, based on production and annual quotas.
Of course, this does not mean that they will not be able to set specific quantitative targets in Copenhagen.
Now, more than ever, we need a coordinated response at European level and the initiatives of the Member States ought to be structured in terms of and aligned with the provisions of the document we are discussing today.
They are European and international, and we have to have a modern rule book.
In the general campaign for upholding human rights, it seems that the problem of violence against women, including domestic violence, is given too little attention.
They often simply seek to convey supposed technical legitimacy and justification on measures that are the result of political choices and evaluations, which are conveniently hidden.
I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to express our appreciation for the excellent work which the Atalanta mission has carried out to date.
Visa-free travel is an important step in this.
Therefore, the Common European Asylum System should be closely linked to the European Development Cooperation Policy and humanitarian work, which would reduce the number of asylum applicants, seekers, who are often economic migrants.
The first aspect is solidarity.
However, today I want to address my remarks to more general issues around the humanitarian aid strategy.
As there were no clear safety evaluation requirements in the Cosmetics Directive in force, the regulation lays down the most essential standards related to this.
Against this background, I would like to thank everyone involved for their hard work.
I would also stress that reopening the debate on own resources is not a new proposal by Parliament, but a decision taken by the Council itself in May 2006, following the agreement reached in December 2005 under the UK Presidency.
The second, for which I am the rapporteur, involves a proposal for a regulation that merely provides for consultation of the European Parliament.
The Commission has abandoned the Lisbon Strategy too fast, without carrying out a thorough analysis of why the objectives of this strategy were not achieved.
Monitoring does not mean that we want to sit at the negotiating table.
I was responsible for this area and am very pleased to tell you what has really been changed.
Are we supposed to be fighting poverty?' - is it not grotesque that poverty and inequality are rising in Europe today?
In this way, we will prevent the radicalisation of opinion in Pakistan.
This oral amendment is to ensure the freedom of women to have safe access to the termination of a pregnancy, but also to affirm the principle that abortion is not a delayed method of contraception nor a means of birth control.
These include prescribing the registration of the company's business object, clarifying that the ban on offering shares to the public does not preclude offers to the employees of the company, or improving the rules on directors' duties and liabilities.
This is much more to do with subsidiarity.
Unfortunately, it is far from over.
We can see this, for example, in the region between Paris, London and Antwerp.
