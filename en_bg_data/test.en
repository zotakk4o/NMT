Secondly, amendments that delete or water down a very precise and specific reference in the report - that controversial political speech should not be criminalised - are amendments that I oppose, and I am glad to hear that many others in this room do as well.

In Europe today, one in four women is a victim of violence, domestic abuse, rape, sexual exploitation, or female genital mutilation.

I therefore hope that, tomorrow, Members will be prepared to rise to the challenge of this very important legislative package for this Parliament, which for the first time in its history is exercising co-legislative powers, just as the Council does.
I dislike not being able to give Members the floor on issues of such importance, but you are also correct in saying that it would require a change to our Rules of Procedure.
Some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 25 November 2010, at 12:00.
Indeed, changes such as extensive structural and regulatory reform of the financial sector must take place, but any improvement of the current situation can only occur through the creation of incentives as well as radical and comprehensive modernisation policies and targeted investment.
For this reason I would ask all my fellow Members to apply a sense of proportion and political foresight to these discharges.
For the CAP to continue delivering for European citizens and to meet their demands, it needs to be strongly supported, and that of course means a strong budget.
Of course, electrical and electronic equipment producers must become more involved in the collection and recycling system, but we cannot absolve the citizens of all responsibility for the waste they produce.
Therefore, I am calling for a simplification of the fundamental principle and, for that reason, I have abstained.
For this, we need a regulation with an ordinary legislative procedure and we are waiting to consult with the European Council and the Member States on these issues.
The Copenhagen conference is approaching and the EU must play a vital role in negotiating a comprehensive and ambitious global agreement for combating climate change.
There is a need in this House to reassess what we have done from the issue of micro credits to tackling racial violence, and for all of these complex issues, we must have a comprehensive strategy.
Immigration is a common concern in the EU countries, which is why the latter must act in concert to find an appropriate response to this problem.

Madam President, by the time I sit down, 16 people will have died of starvation.
However, it is depressing that the country is still mired in domestic and political chaos.
They will often succeed, and in consequence, investment and hence commerce in all Member States will be hamstrung and hobbled.
I therefore believe that you have welcomed, as has the Council, President Obama's decision to close Guantánamo within a year.
I strongly encourage the Commission to stand by the proposed measures and not to give up under Member States' pressure, because only a few can be seen as examples these days.
How is the European Union involved?
Parliament's call for stronger consumer protection and the fight against energy poverty is now enshrined in the legislative texts.
The work programme defines the content criteria and indicative budget of the call for proposals which will be launched in 2009.
Everyone is talking about economic governance, but what does it actually mean in specific terms?
Parliament has the following message, which is supported by a large, overall majority.
It is only the findings and calculations made over a longer period of time that will reveal the economic situation of the two parties, the bilateral improvement in the trade balance, or the contribution made to improvements in the social situation.
The beginning was reassuring: in 1995, a global consensus was reached according to which women and men were equal from all points of view, including political, economic, legal and social.
We called that the Community method.
harmonisation of statistical data collection;
rapporteur. - (ES) Commissioner Barrot, you have my support; what you are asking the House for, you have from this rapporteur, at least, and you have it right from the first line of my report.
We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that the necessary regulation of financial services takes place.
I sincerely hope the Commission and the Member States will act on its constructive suggestions.
With hackers currently boasting on the Internet about how easily fingerprints can be forged on German registration forms and pointing out that, if identity cards are reduced to credit card format, the photos can be digitally mastered, making biometric readability difficult, doubts about this technology could easily arise.
The first is the exceptional mobilisation of the aid machinery and the world of solidarity that sent thousands of volunteers to support the people struck by the first stage of the emergency.
I am sorry that Commissioner de Gucht is not even listening to what I am saying but chooses to talk to his colleague instead.
(FR) Mr President, 2009 was, without doubt, the most difficult year for the euro since its introduction, but it was also the most useful.
The report adopts well-defined guidelines and specific measures for safeguarding jobs, ensuring high quality employment throughout Europe.
Such prosperity will not come about overnight, and therefore we can expect a further increase in the stream of economic migrants leaving North Africa.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are both considering submitting an application.
To conclude, I would like to mention another key point and that is making the maritime sector attractive to young people.
Every time we meet with tobacco growers, one of the questions they most frequently ask is: What will become of us?
I will say again that 56% of complaints received are resolved amicably.
I would call it climate justice, because this is about the relation between developing and developed countries and the will to present a credible proposal for the financing of both mitigation and adaptation measures and the way we also show our willingness to lead the way.
My colleague, Mrs Vassiliou, apologises for not being present at this debate in person, but she has asked me to give her personal thanks to the rapporteur for all that he has done and the efforts he has made to achieve the goal.
It is Europe's duty not to remain silent but, again and again, to repeat and remind, and insist respectfully and firmly that Russia meet its obligations.
For one thing, not all Member States have consular protection and in many cases what consular protection there is is very limited and the security structures are insufficient even for the consuls themselves.
(PL) The Europe 2020 strategy cannot do as much as we are saying, here, today.
(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your very detailed reply.
If you consider, for example, the situation in railway stations, it is fundamentally similar to that in airports.
Over the 10 years I have sat in this Chamber, I did wonder how we were going to get there when we were passing regulation after regulation that was stifling business and opportunity and, indeed, encouraging business to move away from the continent of Europe.
After the Second World War, when Europe slowly came to accept that the independence of African countries was eventually inevitable, Kenya was emphatically excluded, as was the country we now know as Zimbabwe.
Europe needs to develop 2020 strategies enabling the market to be the leading agent in economic regeneration while, at the same time, generating acceptance by the citizens by protecting their interests, by the consumers by defending their rights, and by small and medium enterprises by providing them with the right incentives.
In addition, we wish to increase our efforts in relation to apprentices, adults and older people who are no longer in education and who may miss out on the development.
I feel the same.
I am absolutely convinced that this will also create differences between Member States in terms of the number of visa applications.
There has been a very constructive atmosphere and I think this shows the necessity for the European Union of achieving this and also the interest on the Turkish side in reaching an agreement with us on re-admission.
Council and Commission statements on preparations for the European Council meeting (28-29 October),
Europe must hammer home this message tirelessly.
These experiments have already been conducted in several countries, particularly in Latin America, where prices have grown exponentially and quality has deteriorated.
This is why, faced with this challenge, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the authorities to be aware of how public investment might be reduced in these fields, at the very time when weak growth and reduced private investment cannot take up the slack and, therefore, ensure the recovery of public finances in the short term.
This is specific action which the citizens of Member States of the European Union expect of us.
The technical rules proposed on the basis of scientific advice have been simplified in comparison with current legislation, and will facilitate inspection on board and reduce costs for fishermen.

The division of competences between the Member State Presidency and the President of the European Council will be of great significance.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council's request to open negotiations with Japan on the conclusion of a free trade agreement must be assessed very carefully.
The European Parliament believes that the adoption of the law on the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information by the Lithuanian Parliament represents a clear violation of the treaty.
Formal sitting - Georgia
Madam President, I am, on the whole, pleased that this 5th World Water Forum is to be held in Istanbul and, above all, that the European Union is to participate with a delegation from the Commission, and also one from the European Parliament.
The absence of such measures is particularly regrettable.
In the future, close attention needs to be paid to the cohesion and structural policies, as well as to the agricultural policy, and also to the support given to SMEs, since the capacity of Europe to become a sustainable and competitive economy depends on the latter.
I support this report, which once again points out that we should help Moldova to recover economically, taking into account that about 40% of its economy is dependent on agriculture.
Unfortunately, the way in which this report has been received suggests that no conciliation has come about and instead there appears to have been even greater polarisation.
On the other hand, a country which still depends, to a large extent, on coal-based energy production is facing a technological gap which it needs to bridge, while also reducing its pollutant emissions.
When the Treaty of Lisbon was sold to the people, one of the arguments presented was that it would give the European Parliament more influence.
Clearly, it is the action of taking people in and also the ways in which we need to do this which combine to give rise to integration and all it entails.
The truth is that the Commission has put forward some ambitious proposals, that we constantly monitor the economic situation, and that we will present further proposals when they prove necessary.
We have, therefore, a situation in which there is someone in a Polish prison who has been given a sentence which is not in accord with the principles of Polish law.
This is the position that we need to strengthen and help to consolidate.
Some people think that we would create a parallel system if we had a one-stop shop per corridor and not functional national one-stop shops, which should perhaps be included.
In the rush to enlargement, I fear that this Parliament and the EU institutions are ignoring issues of strategic importance to Member States.
We voted in favour of this report by a Czech Member of this House from our political group because we believe it addresses a subject of the greatest importance: addressing the challenge of energy efficiency through information and communication technologies (ICTs).
Far from it, we need to keep the labour market borders open, with the proviso that the flow of workers is legal and suited to the relevant state's needs.
Thank you for your attention.
I therefore voted for the proposal tabled by Parliament to call on the Commission to carry out an impact study, and an analysis of the costs, benefits and governance structure of a European Credit Rating Foundation competent in the various areas of ratings: the public sector, companies and finance instruments.
I would just appeal to Members of this House to consider the irony of the similarity between that argument and the one that was trotted out in the aftermath of the French, Dutch and Irish 'no' votes.
Baroness Ashton, let us act quickly and for the best, because this will be another important test for Europe.
We are looking at a violation of human rights that we must all condemn, without exception, and so I am voting in favour of this resolution and adding my voice to those of my fellow Members in urging all parties to remain calm and refrain from all acts of violence.
Access to the network: cross-border exchanges in electricity (
It was also said that, in order for others to join the EU, we in the EU must be well integrated, because then the reception of new Member States will be effective.
Interest in social housing results, on the one hand, from regulations concerning public aid, but also concerns the definition which is used in the case of identifying qualified costs for structural funds.
Meanwhile, it is the case that everywhere the EU controls and manages funds itself, it runs things in accordance with the rules.
Our new economic architecture is now largely in place, therefore.
Changing them could mean changes in the fishing framework, and could even cause disputes with local fisheries, which mainly use horse mackerel to provide quality fish to the public.
Profit growth and modern development are integral elements of today's universities, but, with many faculties unrelated to business and profit-driven professions - and I am thinking of arts and the humanities in particular - it is important that, in order to retain a balance between both economic and intellectual success, modern universities retain some essential academic links with their more financially naive past.
You will also find this in our programme.
My committee was not involved in the resolution at all.
We have another example of this in the shape of a major problem at the Medicines Agency, which I believe we will have the opportunity to discuss again.
The diversionary tactics aimed at areas of the financial market represent the wrong approach.
I am pleased that there is satisfaction with the first results, but it goes without saying that this is not yet enough.
Little by little, red tape and legislation - which, until recently, nipped in the bud the development of innovative small companies - has been stripped away and young people are starting to see a glimmer of a stable future that is hopefully full of opportunities.
I assure you that because of my interest in my portfolio, I will follow what happens very closely.
To begin with, just to mention something that is coming up soon, 8 March is going to be an important day, as it is International Women's Day, when the European Parliament in Strasbourg will discuss the Women's Charter.
We must have global supervision of financial markets.
This place looks more and more like the Soviet Union every day.
Yves, your team, your ministers, and also your political and diplomatic corps have done a fantastic job.
That is why I voted as I did.
We have enacted legislation on a great many things.
If the troops have not been able to bring peace to Afghanistan, neither has the money that we have poured in.
We should also expect acknowledgement of the European ambitions of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, and that Russia will be called upon to stop putting political pressure on these countries.
In future, the taxpayer should not be made to pay for the damage.
Clearly the debate on state aid focuses primarily on so-called public service broadcasters, as defined by each Member State, given the basically minimal resources which they have at their disposal and, above all, the important public service role allocated to them.
Turkey's flattery of the Iranian President, its invitation to the Sudanese President, who is wanted for genocide, to attend a conference, and its dealings with Israel, seem to indicate that it is turning away from the West.
The drivers behind this question as far as the Committee on Petitions is concerned are nature, which is a contentious matter locally, how the local economy is allowed to develop, and, above all - and I will come back to this subsequently - the uniform application of the law in the European Union.
Even the best ideas, much as they may be desirable, will not become reality if there is not enough finance.
In the past, he might have languished for years without being brought back to court.
(PL) Mr President, I endorse the draft decision of the European Parliament granting discharge to the Secretary-General of the Council in respect of implementation of the budget for the financial year 2007.
Micro-credits and even credits granted to entrepreneurs from Community funds provide an institutional lever which can and must plug the gap left by commercial banks as a result of the financial crisis which is already hitting the real economy.
Beef imports will increase by 70%, poultry imports by 25%.
Apart from the fact that some areas of medicine in countries with high medical standards could rapidly be overwhelmed, there is also the risk that poorer EU Member States, which have invested less in healthcare, will be required to pay massive costs.
Human rights are a key element in relations between the EU and Eritrea.
I deeply condemn and reject this double standard and call upon my colleagues not to let themselves be influenced by political instigation, and to entrust those in charge, the Commission and the Hungarian Government, with the professional evaluation and conclusion of the problem.
(Applause)
What agriculture is most in need of in the future, however, is regulation that manages to contain the volatility of the markets within certain limits.
We are leading by three goals to one, so it looks as though the Netherlands will reach the final.
I do hope that the Commission and the Council will continue on this path.
The credibility of EU policy and the future of the European Union ultimately depend on effective democracy.
There are four reasons - which I consider to be paramount - why I voted in favour of the report: 1) the simplification and streamlining of procedures in order to make it easier to access funding; 2) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for growth and employment; 3) innovation for a competitive manufacturing sector capable of meeting the challenges of the market; and 4) the risk finance facility, which so far has produced very good results.
Furthermore, the exit from the crisis must, of course, be reflected in that commitment to the strategy, it must be convincing in the change of model for growth and in its emphasis on economic, social and environmental aspects.
It is very important, if it is going to work, that the word 'reinvigorate' is absolutely right.
But we, the Commission, stand ready to kick-start work and contribute to negotiations as soon as the ministers acknowledge that sufficient progress has been made.
We must also acknowledge that there are cultural differences which sometimes seem irreconcilable.
That is, it ends up calling for the same type of monetarist and neoliberal policies and criteria, tightening the veritable stranglehold imposed on the Member States, without a care for the causes of the problems, or for alternative policies that take into account economies' different levels of development.
I have the impression that we would have a great deal to say on the subject of Japan.
(PT) The case of Farai Maguwu illustrates the brutal repression in Zimbabwe and also the need to extend the scope of the Kimberley Process.
In point of fact, we have hardly reacted at all.
The coastal countries of the Middle East and of Africa are advanced developing countries and for us, they are vital in certain fundamental areas, including that of migration flows.
I must also repeat what President Barroso said: that we are much encouraged by Prime Minister Orbán's political commitment to correcting the law if necessary.
It also advocates a safety net and promotes the association of small farmers.
Those are the ideas that I would like to bring together before coming back to you with some proposals on the issue of insurance policies.
At the Informal Meetings of Energy Ministers on 6 and 7 September, the Presidency asked for the first assessments to be carried out, communicated and discussed.
To create a single employment market for researchers, it is also important to define and establish a single European career model in the field of research, and also to introduce an integrated system for information on offers of employment and trainee contracts in the field of research throughout the EU.
Therefore the proposal to use minus is much simpler and clearer.
They expect answers from us, they expect protection and, above all, they need answers now and not in a few months' time.
This proposal is very important and must be monitored by regulators in the Member States.
There are also other facts and policies that are coming to the fore.
in writing. - Mr President, once again it seems the laws we pass here are not being implemented across all Member States.
I will give my reasons for that.
We are proposing very decent measures which are completely in line with all the European Union's objectives.
I think that sustaining employment, as well as creating new employment prospects for the youngest people, but also for those who are on the jobs market but who no longer have jobs, is the sine qua non for Europeans to regain confidence in our social model.
Setting up the European Asylum Support Office is an extremely important step in establishing a European Common Asylum System, as provided for in the European Immigration and Asylum Pact and the Stockholm Programme.
It states that in 2008 alone, 2.7 million more people were infected.
There was good cooperation between the groups, and I think the result is a very good one.
I would argue that it is important to take into account the experience acquired during the years when the old SGP existed, along with the fact that economic governance has become more democratic through the European Parliament's involvement throughout the entire surveillance process.
We should not feel sorry for them, but the system is quite simply unsustainable.
In my region, Galicia, this is considered to be unbeatable competition, which will have serious consequences for employment.
Such women require help from government to re-enter the labour market in order to acquire true economic independence from their abuser.
In fact, one of the difficulties noted is the complexity and burden of administrative procedures, as a result of which researchers seeking European financing are diverted towards national financing and Europe is made unpopular with regard to research.
There would also be the question of the public authorities interfering in the work of such an agency.
These measures have made the democratic process devoid of content and forced a quarter of the country's population to emigrate.
(PL) Madam President, for many years, nuclear power was considered to be the energy of the future - green, efficient, non-polluting.
In Malaysia, over 10 000 people suffer from this form of corporal punishment every year.
I voted enthusiastically for this report, because it promotes the development of so-called intelligent transport systems; that is, the use of new technologies in the field of transport.
I have to say there is something a little bit suspicious about having held back this report until the Irish referendum was safely in the bag and all the votes counted, and then suddenly coming out with a proposal to have EU embassies around the world answerable to this House and a single European diplomatic corps.
Capitalism can only bring more suffering and crisis.
I have taken note of your suggestions.
In this respect, I would like to highlight two issues that I believe to be vital in the face of the current situation of economic crisis and abnormally high unemployment figures in the EU, with a view to protecting quality, decent employment and creating new job opportunities under the 2020 strategy.
We need to prepare for these responsibly.
Madam President, I should, in turn, like to thank you for this interesting debate.
That gives us hope for the future.
The EU 2020 strategy can be different.
- Before the vote
We agree that innovation, creativity and being better necessarily mean market advantage, but we do not accept that, just because someone is bigger and stronger with better connections to information and, in particular, special connections to government, these kinds of advantage should apply on the market, and we are very happy that the Commission is on guard here to ensure that they should not.
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I wish to say that we consider the matter to be extremely serious; it needs immediate action and this is no time for obstruction.
For that, of course, you need ski runs.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Atalanta operation represents a successful contribution by the EU to security in the Horn of Africa and it should be continued.
I feel that a reference to the FIFA World Cup lends itself at the moment to describe the situation: the ball is now in the Council's half.
Implementing measures (Rule 88): see Minutes
These ambitions are to give the European people more say, to make the European Union more democratic and also, in this way, to advance European integration.
One of the things that I think will be very interesting as the Commission begins to look at the future of the GSP regulation is to see whether aspects of that regulation that concern the ratification and implementation of human rights and conventions could be improved.
Therefore, we have also tabled an amendment that seeks to root the budget more firmly in reality, something that I hope the other groups will be able to support when we vote later today.
It is deemed regrettable that Russia is averse to the introduction of effective measures to ensure that the many cases in which the Russian authorities have violated human rights and been condemned by the European Court of Justice will not be repeated.
There are dozens of stateless nations that should be mentioned, bearing in mind the fact that what the founding fathers wanted to build was a Europe of the nations, not a federalist Europe or a Europe of the biggest interests.
In other words, universities do not always take market needs into account and the ones worst affected by this are the young people who have just finished their studies.
The challenges facing us are complex, and the responses must necessarily be holistic.
Many European Union Member States have stated their readiness to help in every possible way - technical ways, sending advisors, preparing whatever means are necessary - but this must, first of all, be with the consent of the relevant states there.
This is the other side of the coin.
After all, producers have had ten years to comply.
Openness should also be a key principle in the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).
Patients, too, have the right to benefit from freedom of movement.
The Parliament needs strengthening, which is an important priority for both the Commission and the European Parliament.
Eleven years on from a provision having been passed, it is hard to understand how it can be that so few steps have been taken for its implementation.
Only the secondary market (repair and maintenance services and supply of spare parts) would remain subject to a specific exemption regime.
As you might be aware, there are some outstanding issues, namely, the questions of energy and trade.
I also think it is important for us to look at the functioning of our procurement procedures here in Parliament.
An analysis of the management of H1N1 influenza in Europe highlights a basic problem: an absence of independent assessment by national and/or European health authorities, and the resulting inability to adapt public health measures in the best possible way and in real time to the actual clinical and epidemiological statistics available.
I hope this Parliament will play a key role in ensuring that the CAP is not demeaned or diminished in any way.
If there is a rise in imports due to these talks, I believe we will see an exodus of farmers from the industry.
We would have had to deal with speculation and competitive devaluation among more than 20 national currencies.
We cannot separate our economic and our social agenda: there can be no economic recovery on the foundations of social collapse, just as there can be no social progress in an economic desert.
Work is more than just paid employment and both young and older people contribute substantially, including through their work in the family, to making our society more humane and improving the stability of services and workplaces.
That is why the Verts/ALE Group demands a referral back to the committee, not because we believe that we cannot improve the situation but because this involves pushing through a reform that will make our legislative life very difficult in the future.
(DE) Mr President, I think that we are making good legislation today.
You owe that to all those who have fought for fundamental rights and freedom of the press, and you owe it to my generation, which has never known anything different.
Let us therefore stop deceiving ourselves, let us stop deceiving public opinion in Europe and the Turks, and let us finally put a stop to negotiations with Turkey.
Violations of international humanitarian law are increasingly common.
This should be a dialogue based on respect for international law and the territorial integrity of states.
Let me mention just two of the recommendations in the report.
Therefore, there is no doubt that the constant increase in food prices as a result of increased commodity prices is an increasingly pressing concern for the EU.
Furthermore, I hope that Member States will use the various instruments currently available more efficiently to combat Roma exclusion, such as allocating a maximum of 2% of ERDF resources to be used for housing for marginalised communities or the existing options as part of the ESF.
Mr President, lest you - or colleagues - think that the questions on Mercosur that I and other colleagues raised are inadmissible because they are not good questions, I believe they are inadmissible because the item is on the agenda for Thursday.
What has happened is that we have again heard pleas for more cooperation and more European-level coordination and the single European sky - something to which references have already been made - will prove helpful in the future.
We have a situation where Members have been indignant that they were not allowed to speak, but have not stayed to hear either the Commissioner or the rapporteur explain and set out the conclusions.
I should underline the strong view of the international community that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.
The Russian authorities are evidently implementing unconstitutional law and order.
The first conclusion, for me, is that we also continue to need a strong European common agricultural policy.
We thus need the supervision issues in this area to be defined.
The enlargement process of the European Union continues on exclusively geographical premises and, as I have already stated in this House, the Council is being hasty in granting the status of candidate country for accession before the countries in question reach democratic quality standards that at least approach a basically adequate level.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of projects; to strengthen their procurement authorisation at the financing decision and work-programme level; to correct failings in the recruitment of personnel, and increase its objectivity and transparency; and to implement and comply with the Financial Regulation to which they are subject.
(HU) Mr President, the report we have in front of us is perhaps the most important one of this period.
What we are currently experiencing, Mr President, is not, in my opinion, a monetary crisis in the Union, it is not even a crisis of our single currency; rather, it is a crisis of EU governance.
The science says that two degrees means rich countries must reduce their CO2 emissions by 40%.
What I would like to say to you first of all is that the Stockholm Programme really has taken account of the fate of victims.
I voted in favour.
We will work very closely with Member States and with Parliament to come up with a solution that improves our capacity to respond to disasters, and there is a very simple logic behind it.
This is the case for environmental and public health reasons, due to the high levels of pollution associated with it, and for energy reasons related to dwindling oil reserves and growing difficulty of access to this commodity.
Sweden will shortly have the opportunity to put it into practice during its presidency in the second half of this year.
A few years ago Lithuania was also in the same situation, but the inflation indicator lacked one tenth of a percentage point.
We do not need a war.
A lot has been achieved since the last EEAP, but there is no evidence that the target can be met by 2020.
As you know, the major objectives identified in the Europe 2020 strategy include an increase in the number of jobs, better conditions for research and development, an improvement in education levels - we touched on this in a previous question - and the promotion of social inclusion, including poverty reduction.
I am particularly proud of the fact that in the new European executive, Italy is providing, in the person of Mr Tajani, continuity of merit and competence by being awarded one of the key portfolios, namely that of industry, which is of strategic importance in managing the crisis and in the reorganisation of European production.
We must therefore do everything to guarantee the competitiveness and sustainability of this sector, while not forgetting environmental and human factors.
Tonnes of waste are generated every day, causing harm to the environment and negative impacts on public health and quality of life.
Albania will manage.
Do we expect nothing more of Russia's democratisation?
That is the point: if we do not get this right, we bring the whole of European law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute.
I think it is only right that we remember those victims too.
We expect you to make progress on this matter.
However, at a time when the economic and financial crisis is heightening social inequalities, structural fund allocations to the Member States are in decline.
Thank you.
We will be vigilant on the basic principles of our proposal.
The Member States must integrate this priority to acquire basic skills (reading, writing, arithmetic) into their educational programmes before their pupils specialise.
What we need is another economic and social model that opposes capitalism.
I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small - but still too many.
It also guarantees that public authorities will always be able to regulate in favour of the general interest.
They are so comprehensive that only 12 third countries outside Europe are able to meet all these requirements, and consequently, we only import beef from these few countries.
I believe, I trust in you, Lady Ashton.
In the five years of his mandate, Mr Barroso, who harnessed the support of certain EU countries for George W. Bush's war in Iraq, has never been able to revive the European Union or to strengthen it in the face of national self-interest.
In the wake of the recent deadly earthquake in Italy, does the Commission take the view that it is covered by its written answer of 22.7.2008 and the answers furnished by Mr Barroso and Mr Dimas or does it intend to take further initiatives to protect European citizens from earthquakes?
Just as with other horizontal air agreements, this agreement provides for an EU designation clause permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment, deals with safety issues and the taxation of aviation fuel and resolves potential conflicts with EU competition rules.
Some have defined Copenhagen as a perfect storm with a bittersweet result.
These researchers certainly no longer have any need for Italian, since they have learnt English, French and German and have all the tools required to submit these patents, to the detriment of Italian products.
He will be 20 this year.
Please take into account the rather difficult situation currently facing farmers and ensure fair competition for European farmers.
Intensive cooperation at parliamentary level is also necessary, for example, with organisations such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the WTO, and with the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank.
I did not vote in favour of this report on agriculture and international trade since it hinges on the central element of EU trade policy: free trade agreements.
Yes, Europe is the world's biggest donor of humanitarian aid - we can be proud of that, and it must continue - but it is not humanitarian aid on its own that is going to resolve the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Now what?
If sufficient financial resources are not available for these objectives, then the initiative will remain a dead letter.
In order to obtain much wider support for its positions, the EU must create coalition-building mechanisms and start to organise regular meetings on specific issues with all the democratic states on other continents.
Additional investments in the first-instance procedure improve the efficiency of the asylum process.
Use of information technology for customs purposes (
Push hard for this, let us not give in!
The joint EULEX project with which the European Union is hoping to gain influence within Kosovo seems more like an instrument to conceal this internal division than anything else.
If we, in Europe, do not succeed in daring to start anew with fair requirements, then we will end up exactly where we do not want to be, namely with protectionism and with a repeat of 1933 and subsequent years in Europe.

Similarly, we need to monitor the situation that has come about in the Mediterranean, particularly on the Italian coast, where 4 000 landings were recorded in just four days.

The transport potential, hitherto only utilised to a minimum, as well as other opportunities for development, require a speedy start-up of the entire project.
We assert that they are essential to the health of the European economy.
Mr. Van Rompuy says the EU's capacity to reach consensus remains intact and so it is, but unfortunately there is only consensus on the lowest common denominator!

Yet Europe is not built with ideal candidates.
I must also insist on the need for long-term planning in buildings policy, with a view to ensuring budgetary sustainability.
Mr President, could I raise a wider issue here?
It is also unfortunate because the Hungarian Government, and Hungary as a country, currently holds the Presidency of the European Union.

That is called business for the moment in the budget issues of the Union.
We voted in favour of the report on a Single Market for Europeans.
I am grateful for Parliament's broad support for the improvement of the proposal to streamline the authorisation procedure.

Discrimination still thrives in the workplace, there is deep segregation of the labour market according to gender, the pay gap continues, there is still a shortage of women in decision-making positions and politics and insufficient support for motherhood and single mothers.

Moreover, the inclusion of social and environmental standards in trade agreements contributes to regulate globalisation.

Secondly, we need to assist the Sahel countries in enhancing the capabilities of the security sectors - army, police, justice and border control systems - in each country.

That is why any evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities should be linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and its implementation.
We are in a situation where we are seeing that growth cannot always be continual, rather it is restricted by the limited nature of natural resources and the limited capacity of the earth to absorb and metabolise our waste.
It is even more worrying when conservative governments, such as the current Czech Presidency, talk about revising the Barcelona targets and going back to home childcare.
First, we need to create suitable conditions for women so that they can actually work in these high positions, which means adequate childcare, adequate working facilities, flexitime and other conditions which actually allow women to be in these high positions.
The concern that honourable Members from different persuasions have about making sure that the role that we play in the European Union in the forthcoming elections and the weeks ahead is the right one.

Today, as then, we care about building trust and friendly relations between our nations.
Closure of sitting
I would also like to highlight the fact that Parliament is united in requesting an Operations Centre, and I am glad that you, High Representative, have declared yourself open to a more exhaustive discussion of this idea.

But there are aspects with which we disagree, such as the link that is claimed between energy efficiency and what is called the Europe 2020 Strategy, which provides for the creation of a single market in energy, the promotion of market-based instruments, the European Emissions Trading System masking some of the profits from energy efficiency, and overlooking the need to defend a strong energy public sector that each State needs to promote.
Without commitments to improve multilateral surveillance within the IMF and further involvement of economies other than the current members, little effective success can be foreseen.
Our mental health policy is articulated in a document called A Vision for Change and many of the calls for action in the rapporteur's report are stated in our national policy or, indeed, are enshrined in our legislation.

Mr President, allow me to say that some critical issues have emerged in relation to the Bank's activity.

For making abortion more accessible is an indicator of how our culture has fallen, and shows our departure from human values.
The Geneva Agreement will not put an end to the trade war that pits us, in fact, against the United States, since, at the same time as it was selling off the banana sector in Europe and in the ACP countries, in exchange for the legal disputes at the WTO being dropped, the Commission was negotiating even more advantageous agreements with a handful of Central and South American countries.
I reject the notion that religious leaders should be restricted in their freedom of conscience and religion concerning homosexuality.

Tibet, in particular self-immolation by nuns and monks (
We have a directive which clearly cannot be implemented, and what has been the reaction of this Parliament?
Whereas in the United States, for example, they do not burden the social system, and in some States they also have to leave once their job comes to an end, through the increasing level of equality with the resident population that they have been afforded in recent years, they constitute an ever greater burden for those States with traditionally well-developed social systems if they remain in the country permanently after losing their jobs and if, as a result of them bringing any family they have to join them, all the relatives have to be supported, too.
The issue of an agricultural product quality policy has found an authoritative and unanimous response from the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thereby making the existing legislation more complete.

This is a step towards the gradual phasing-out of nuclear power, which we advocate.
The measures they are planning - assisting job search, training and retraining, starting small companies, assisting self-employment - are all ideally suited for support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
However, here, once again, I have to thank the High Representative, because I have been informed that she also wants to say something about this and that she regards it as a major obligation and a major necessity and will also make another declaration of commitment in this regard, which, although not a component of the Staff Regulations, will reassure us and those who view it as particularly important as we look to the future work of the common External Action Service.
In connection with the implementation of the directive, I am very concerned that the points of single contact, which are supposed to make life easier for entrepreneurs by providing information on doing business in a given country, as well as in other Member States, are functioning in only 14 countries so far.

The period within which the Member States have to transpose these directives into legislation is two years.

More than 1 200 bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States under different, frequently incompatible, legal regimes need to be placed comprehensively under the auspices of the European Union without impairing the rights of the parties involved.

In effect our decision is based on the considerations of the Court of Auditors, which issued an opinion with reservations on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the budget of the European Police College, by reason of the fact that the procurement procedures did not conform to the provisons of the financial regulation.Therefore I support the request to the College and its Governing Board to inform the discharge authority, by 30 June 2011, of the actions undertaken and improvements made in relation to all the irregular and/or incomplete points raised in the course of this procedure.

draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on this communication, which it has presented openly in just the way we had imagined in the past.
The recent decisions by the Commission on permanent spending cuts will have painful consequences on public health and care and workers' insurance rights and pensions which, in conjunction with the demand for higher taxes, will drastically reduce the standard of living of the grassroots classes.

However, there have also been incidents which are a cause for our concern.
It is also just as important to increase the loans for the European network of employment services.

(FR) Mr President, I must say that the compromise on sugar, such as was negotiated in the trialogue, falls short of what we had proposed in the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I deeply regret this.
At present, it does not take account of the different needs of women and their economic and social conditions.
However, we must recognise that this new step does not reduce the current competences of the Union and its institutions.
This factor constitutes an important legal aspect distinguishing the EPAs from the previous commercial preferences which were implemented under the Cotonou Convention and which were detrimental to trade between the ACP countries and the EU and caused considerable uncertainty.
The Commission also continues to follow closely the closure case against the DTP currently pending in the Constitutional Court.
Another issue that has been high up on the agenda of the various G20 summits is the reform of the international financial institutions, as already mentioned by Mrs Malmström.

This is why the Commission firmly believes that a vibrant and strong parliamentary dimension reinforces the democratic legitimacy of the partnership.
I firmly believe that this cooperation must be consolidated, which also means finding new forms of cooperation.
Finally, the EU's commitment to open trade goes hand in hand with its commitment to sustainable development, which is an overarching policy objective for the EU, including in the context of various trade policy initiatives.
On the other hand, Commissioner Wallström, who very kindly came to Ireland on a number of occasions, will have picked up a strong undercurrent, which I believe exists in all Member States, of people who are disconnected from what the European Union is about.
The purpose of the present proposal is to extend these transitional arrangements for a further 18 months, i.e. until 1 January 2013, so that a new package of technical measures can be drawn up - which will be the subject of a proposal submitted by the Commission in 2011 - as part of the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy.
However, this plan must not detract from the EU's focus on the Eastern Partnership.

Sadly, Turkey wants to join the European Union because they will have their hands out in the hope of having them filled with lots of European taxpayers' money in subsidies, and they see the opportunity of offloading millions of their poor and unemployed excess population by exporting them to Western countries like Britain, where they will either work for low wages or go on the benefits system.
We are dealing with an unacceptable situation because a country is taking a stance in its international relations against one of its own citizens.
That is why other forums - also having started with higher retention proposals - are tending to settle on 5% too.
I would not dare to do so, but if we are leading by example, and, if we are putting down ideas between Parliament and the Commission about the ways we can see of regenerating new growth and about being innovative within the new economy, then the Member States must also step up to the plate and take those actions.

The resumption of negotiations with Mercosur, decided unilaterally by the European Commission, does not bode well for European agriculture, which is experiencing an unprecedented crisis.

Strong emphasis must also be focused on the development of the least developed areas, especially small regions falling behind the regional average and struggling with far more severe disadvantages than even other areas surrounding them.
Both these countries have achieved great success in the Union, and we must not forget this, despite the fact that, today, they both stand before difficult economic reforms.
Therefore, I believe that the Commission must also behave responsibly with regard to the competences granted to it by the Treaties.
The objective of this report is to give maritime transport passengers a framework of legal protection that is similar to the one that already exists for rail and air transport, with particular emphasis on passengers with disabilities and restricted mobility.
General Motors is not closing Opel Belgium because it is in difficulties: it has made a EUR 3.4 million profit, but this has not prevented it from getting rid of 2 600 jobs.
So where are we today?
(FR) 'Europe quite rightly wants to equip herself with a common policy and currency but, most of all, she needs a soul'.
Adjournment of the session
First-rate officials and outstanding ministers, such as Karel Schwarzenberg, Saša Vondra, Ondřej Liška and others, as well as Prime Minister Fischer have done an excellent job.
Nevertheless, we believe that it needs to be ensured that volunteering does not come to substitute action by Member States, and that it must not be used as a way of fulfilling needs which are the responsibility of the social services.
Therefore, the commitment the European Union intends to make over the next few years, in terms of coordinating policies at European level, is positive.
The Commission will also reflect on how Regulation (EC) 2004/2003 could be further improved in the longer term in order to support the development of stronger and genuinely transnational political parties and foundations at European level, with a view to developing a truly political European public space.
Why, there are one or two Members from the liberal group here.
Providing access to food for all, against a backdrop of rising global demand and food shortages for several billion people across the world, is a huge and essential challenge.
These actions have heightened the risks associated with the loss of confidence, distortion of competition, legal uncertainty and the high level of costs incurred for bailing out the banks, borne by taxpayers.
The reason why I did not vote 'yes' to the amendments is because they were phrased in a very old-fashioned way, as though we were having a discussion on the Tobin tax 20 years ago.
As mentioned previously, the proposal's objectives are incredibly important - so important that they have been given a separate legal basis in Article 194 of the Treaty of Lisbon, in which they are practically listed word for word.
The democratic legitimacy of the new service also depends on its composition.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate on the European Union's energy choices, one thing is certain: the most significant, cheapest and most sustainable energy source available to us is saved energy.
The walls erected in Ceuta and Melilla, for example, to ward off the arrival of men and women fleeing war, poverty and global warming, the walls stretching from the detention centres, the gates of our cities as far as the Libyan desert, via Lampedusa, where even children are locked up in the name of the Return Directive.
Some Member States have been simply overlooking the need to invest in modernising their plants for years.
They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States, as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929, and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place.
We have three people in the Commission who have the right to give an opinion, but the positions of the Commission are the positions expressed by the President on behalf of the college and by the relevant Commissioner.
To me it seems unreasonable for MEPs to expect immunity, and we should equally bear the burden of the economic crisis.
After centuries of Turkish rule and the last century of Serbian rule, the last thing they need is coercion from outside.
This is essential to enable you to assess this properly and to discuss it with your voters.
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
Please tell Mr Barroso this, on my behalf.
In the European Union, the frontier is already moving: proposals on capital adequacy and credit-rating agencies have been presented by the Commission and are currently being discussed also by this Parliament.
In light of this, I ask you: has the Commission studied the repercussions of these austerity policies, which you push for and pressure countries into following in order to get out of the crisis?
These are empty words these days, especially for the estimated 15 million Christians living in Pakistan.
We must do everything in our power to protect the common currency, the euro, and calm the markets.
And yet, we will not be able to put an end to the economic crisis in Europe until those responsible have been identified.
At the Bureau meeting, I am going to try to change this provision, because we cannot permit a situation where Members whose names are on the list of speakers are prevented from speaking because other Members interrupt with questions - at the moment, a legitimate practice.
This has now changed.
The European Parliament's motto 'United in diversity' is the principle that must guide all our work within and outside the European Union.
I share the concerns of the majority of Europeans with regard to Iran's nuclear programme and the assurances of the Iranian regime that it will only be used for civilian purposes.
From my point of view, there were two controversial amendments.
(Applause)
Several generation changes will probably be required for this minority to assume certain rules of social coexistence.
That is a statement in an authorised interview in de Volkskrant of 7 October 2009.
If the Commission's proposal were to have been implemented as it was originally presented, it would have meant that in Denmark we would have roughly doubled the number of pesticides on the market.
Although we share this aim, it is an unfortunate fact that we cannot yet do without animal testing, nor are we yet in a position to say definitively when this will be the case.
The UK must ensure its dwindling gas supplies are kept as a national resource and not allow them to become an EU common resource.
A stable and multi-ethnic Kosovo is a key priority for the European Union.
It is therefore essential that the European Commission - and I know, Vice-President, that you are aware of this - presents us with genuine solutions, as soon as possible, so that we can protect passengers if the airline they were due to fly with goes bankrupt, regardless of the means by which they booked their ticket.
I do not support the resolution because, despite the obvious deficiency of the progress made and the discrepancies with the acquis communautaire, it looks forward to accession that may take place, in my opinion, too soon.
in writing. - The state of affairs in Belarus has deteriorated over recent months and is now of great concern.
We must also emphasise the extent to which a healthy fiscal policy is essential.
Madam President, let me be very brief: we have two reports to go, and the climate debate is a crucial one because we are sending a signal to the Council, which is starting tonight.
We therefore chose to abstain in the final vote.
Parliament has always faithfully celebrated this date, but unfortunately this date has not yet achieved the scope that it should have within the European institutions and Member States.
This will allow us to encourage vehicle manufacturers to use eco-innovation to ensure the European car industry's competitiveness.
What is more, I do not wish to miss the opportunity to point out that this proposal will lead to a significant reduction in noise pollution from roads since reducing tyre noise levels will bring about a significant improvement in this situation.
Referral back to committee for reconsideration of amendments tabled in plenary (Rule 156): see Minutes
Countries are eligible if they have already put budget supports into practice in a satisfactory way as part of the ninth EDF, as well as those that demonstrate a strong commitment to ensuring the monitoring and achievement of the MDG.
In transport, there are no short cuts, there are no short-term solutions, and this should be an opportunity - even more so now that the White Paper is being drawn up - to include, introduce and establish the necessary measures to reduce our excessive dependence on our air transport connections.
Furthermore, the Member States have underlined once again their solidarity with those of their number most directly affected by migratory movements, and have reiterated their readiness to provide necessary support as the situation evolves.

The consumer would be the victim, with the possibility of excluding citizens from the Internet: a very serious matter.
It will only be possible for citizens and businesses to enjoy the full benefits of the internal market once this aim is realised.
Since then, through his consistent and persistent commitment to represent genuine autonomy for his people, the Dalai Lama has offered the world a model on how to pursue democracy through non-violent means.
Dates for next sittings: see Minutes

However, with my fellow Commissioners, I share the wish expressed in your discharge resolution: we want to see, soon, a measurable acceleration of the progress made over the last years in improving the financial management of the European budget, including the reinforcement of the main stakeholders' responsibility and accountability.
My understanding is that it is only 79% accurate, which will cause major problems for farmers throughout the UK.
In such a context of crisis, we must take this opportunity to convert and retrain the labour market, so as to avoid negative social impacts.
in writing. - (IT) Information and communication technology (ICT) is now an integral part the economy and society of the European Union.
What we want is a first real analysis of cohesion policy programmes for the period 2007-2013.
When it comes to trade and energy, we are, rather, mutually dependent or, to put it another way, we have each become an indispensible partner for the other.
Employee rights, trade union rights and social protection need to be given at least the same significance as - and, indeed, precedence over - the internal market and freedom to provide services.
The scanners used must have a safety certificate allowing their use in all Member States.
The main objective of the common agricultural policy (CAP), enshrined in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is 'to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour'.
; and
It is vital that sufficient fund managers are available to maintain a proper watch on MC passports.
Measures such as financial support for people who have completed university are essential for a smooth transition to the labour market.
The need to deliver cleaner air has been recognised for several decades with action having been taken at national and EU level and also through international conventions.
I believe that that could help enormously to increase understanding and knowledge of, and trust in, the EU.
I refer, of course, to the Treaty of Lisbon, an important treaty, the epicentre of which is the citizen, the basic pillar of which is how all of us, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, can get closer to the citizens.
Therefore, it is the only way to guarantee the future of small and medium-sized agriculture, as well as the right to produce, and each country's right to food security and food sovereignty.
To include recreational fishing in a Member State fishing quota is for me unacceptable.
Although beneficiaries from rural areas are most affected, there has never been any kind of programme for the Roma communities as part of the European programmes aimed at rural development.
However, with European Union help comes responsibility from the very countries that want to benefit from the institutions and the enhanced economic opportunities.
(ES) Mr President, in the last few weeks we have been moved by the repeated demonstrations of heroism and the bravery of the people of Iran, who have confronted the machine guns and truncheons of their tyrants with their bare hands.
The debate is closed.
There is not a word about what the Swedish Presidency will do to ensure that the so-called guarantees that have been given to the Irish people will also be regarded as such.
However, the question of what remits are given in terms of the relationship between the State and the citizens is, of course, as fundamental as it is sensitive, and one which ought to be discussed here in Parliament.
The high turnout on both election days was particularly encouraging.
Either one is in favour of the free expression of opinion, and accepts all the consequences that this entails, or one is not.
How many times must it be said in this House that, because it nourishes people, because it helps to make the countryside more attractive and to keep populations in rural areas, agriculture cannot be considered as an economic activity like any other?
However, the global financial crisis means that the Member States need to step up their support for the least developed countries, through public development aid and cooperation in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.
In fact, 93% of the milk produced in the EU is sold on the European market and it represents a significant proportion of the income of EU dairy companies.
What has to be said is that if these bonuses are to put the financial system at risk then, undoubtedly, they must be checked.
Where interest rates are concerned, there are some Member States that have set a cap - as a condition, so to speak - which is at around 8 to 9.5 per cent.
They are very specific in relation to meat consumption and I do not think there is a place for these paragraphs in the report.
(SV) I do not need to give you any further details of the terrible case of Dawit Isaak.
I especially find their current fears more than justified in view of the Chinese Government's policy of severe repression towards them, which has now lasted more than 50 years, apart from a brief and, I would say, false truce during the Olympic Games.
The rest of their doctors are all in the United States of America.
However, I would have expected a clear statement from the Head of the Commission about jockeying at national political level and its negative impact on the European Union - after all the collapse of the Portuguese Government coincided precisely with the moment that the government resolved to do exactly what the stability framework required of it.
The main priorities of European agriculture, such as food security, market regulation and spatial planning, are clearly reaffirmed, as are the consequences in budgetary terms, which must be in line with the ambitions of the CAP.
One other point I would make is this: I am a member of the Delegation for relations with Canada, and we could also establish a collegial approach with Canada and like-minded countries to ensure fair play for the High North, and particularly the indigenous people.
Do not think that weak coordination of national economic strategies is sufficient.
There are other instruments that would be a great asset in the current situation.
The countries of the EU should ask themselves if, in a strictly European sense, it is possible to recognise some of Russia's actions as fully democratic.
Ladies and gentlemen, I share the concern of the European people about current developments.
However, from the point of view of greater coherence and better law-making, it would have been more logical if these two proposals had been added to the current asylum package.
The budget for that measure is EUR 6.9 million.
If the Venezuelan government is committed to the rule of law and human rights, it must protect and respect freedom of expression and appreciate the joys of that crucial input that criticism and openness bring to a constitutionally governed country.
The most recent discussions which took place in Romania, in Constanţa, spotlighted Member States' new concerns with regard to the Danube's economic and social development.
A wheelchair user or a guide-dog user should have free access anywhere within the European Union.
I was in the Middle East with the Palestinians during the course of those final days leading up to that vote.
55% were completed within three months.
This is all the more significant because of the current economic crisis.
Let us just remind ourselves that banks are not risk free.
European farmers are operating under strict health and safety criteria.
How can we provide adequate protection for the sources of information that come from those countries which are not safe?
I firmly believe that, in the near future, the Canadian authorities will make every effort to waive these visas.
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, at this late hour on a Monday the Commission will probably have other things on its mind more worrying than this report.
However, I would very much like us to look beyond the ratification process and talk about how we should implement the Treaty of Lisbon, which is a huge step towards political union and the creation of a community of values.
All of us in the EU should be profoundly grateful for the role that the US plays in the world and particularly the role that it has played in our recent history.
We have fallen quite far behind, and there could have been two or three contributions during the time that we have spent on this issue.
The more that those on the right oppose what has been said, the more it becomes clear from your speech, Mr Brown, that we are on the right path.
Mr Trichet, the verbatim records of the debates of the European Central Bank should be published, as is the case in the United States, Japan and Sweden.
I refer in particular to the development of synergies for an integrated approach between the different sectoral policies that exist in the field of regional policy, as highlighted in the report.
The lack of transparency from financial intermediaries has taken the specific form of tax evasion and fraud and has contributed to the tough situation we are currently faced with.
This is likely to end in the autumn of this year, and, once the final texts are initialled by the negotiators, the Commission will submit them to Council for signature and conclusion of the FTA.
A state printing office is all that exists.
Thirdly, look at what we are witnessing now.
There are also Europeans living there - people who want to feel they live in a common Europe.
Sadly, in this House there are many examples of anti-American sentiment.
The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge.
When we add to that the structural difficulties and, in particular, the shortcomings in terms of governance, the challenges faced by those working on the ground are obvious.
These are the specific achievements of Cancún.
I would add a further question to this.
Available policy tools must be used in a way guaranteeing that the trap of a strong interventionist growth model driven by traditional sectorial industrial policy is avoided.
I believe that the package of interventions contained in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council may be effective in preventing macroeconomic imbalances, especially in the euro area.
I consider very important the observation that the economic and financial crisis and the climate change crisis have the same roots.
Is it acceptable that the EU institutions go to the Court of Justice over the Council's decision to moderate the increase in salaries of EU civil servants?
We should follow the good examples provided here, for example, in the cooperation between Norway and Russia in the Shtokman Field in the Barents Sea.
(HU) While on the subject of EU-Russian relations, I must also mention today's formal sitting.
In fact, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will protect fundamental rights and liberties against EU actions.
There is one political issue that is very important.
That is why I am telling you we will try to act quickly on a situation which, at the moment, actually lies in the hands of a Constitutional Court in Prague, Czech Republic.
I wish to draw attention to two parts of the world: firstly, Central Asia.
That would be to the benefit of both sides and would ensure an uninterrupted flow of natural gas to Europe.
Mr President, I rise to draw attention to Rule 28(2) of our Rules of Procedure, which says that any Member can ask the President of Parliament a question and receive an answer within 30 days.
I have voted in favour and I am pleased that this amendment was accepted.
The choice is a simple one: do we want jobless growth or growth with jobs?
Transparency in this process is key.
We share, of course, the same common European objective.
The message we must convey is that democracy cannot be imposed by force, and that it is not acceptable to quash demonstrations by sending in the army with orders to shoot on sight.
Change, as much else, begins at home.
It is therefore necessary to have a strict system of controls to prevent money being squandered or stolen, particularly in fragile countries with high levels of corruption and low levels of governance.
Does it consider the transatlantic relationship more important than questions from MEPs?
According to recent figures, the world's population is steadily increasing, and it is thought that it will increase by around 40% by 2050, creating an increase in demand for food which is expected to double current requirements.
What explains, then, such a lack of foresight, such a casual attitude?
There was agreement about scrapping this project - no one wanted it any more.
Of course I love your King, Swedish freedom and the economy, but please remember that, as long as we have visas, we should not feel comfortable.
(SK) The political conflict in Thailand very quickly grew into serious civil unrest, which resulted in the deaths of many protestors following intervention by the forces of repression.
In addition, the use of online tender systems must be encouraged, which will help eradicate corruption and fraud in the public procurement system.
Tourism, like any other sector of the economy, is increasingly feeling the effects of world competition.
As a Member of the Committee on Development, I support the view that if such a tax is introduced, part of the revenue generated should be devoted to financing development.
I will just give you one example in order to show you how this could work.
It is often these instruments, in fact, which determine the nature of the market today.
As the song says, they are 'the 'I cannot take it anymore' generation', and they are totally in the right.
I welcome the fact that the Council, under the guidance of the Spanish Presidency, has now formulated its position and is able to enter into discussions with Parliament, which has, of course, a particular interest and legitimacy in this matter.
Indeed, I believe that the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the fight against this major scourge.
I would like to raise a case about fundamental rights.
I can understand that and I share it, but I want to assure the House that we move as swiftly as we can.
But this is an important issue, indeed an issue of life or death, and one that for me is doubly important because I have a particular constituency interest in it.
I am in favour of amendment 87 because I think that taxpayers in every country should ensure that the disabled are provided with such finances as allow them to be considered fully credible borrowers by the credit market.
Kosovo can be considered the last piece in the complex Balkan political puzzle.
Opening of the sitting
For us, technical harmonisation is also an important point.
Questions were put to the European Commission concerning transparency of collaborative decision-making processes and better coordination of responses.
This has been ignored in the past.
Besides these tests, the European Union must work to harmonise international standards at the highest level, within the G20 and the International Atomic Energy Agency, on the basis of the Western European Nuclear Regulators' Association's objectives for new reactors.
That is not the Europe that this Parliament expects.
This report is also in favour of supporting SMEs which require a lot of support at this time.
Up to now there has been a lack of transparency in several areas, but there has also been blatant market abuse.
The talks held so far are not enough.
Gas will continue to flow out until the fault has been repaired, because if water got inside, it would cripple the pipeline completely.
This includes, firstly, genuine authorisation for multi-branding.
We will hold an informal European Council in Brussels tomorrow to prepare the EU's common position.
However, the problem is one of who can restore confidence and how it can be restored.
Some will be matters of opinion, and I would not expect the Commission to interfere in those situations, but where outright lies are told about the Community, will the Commission establish a rapid rebuttal unit for the next two or three months, whereby either you can respond directly to lies and distortions about the European Union, or candidates can approach you for factual information to rebut false statements about the activities of the Community?
However, there remain differences in terms of labour legislation between developed and developing countries.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment and excellent cooperation, as this really is an important subject.
The 2010 budget is being drafted in the shadow of the financial crisis.
The two most awkward issues for the treaty are the emission reduction targets of different countries and how the industrialised countries will contribute to the financing of investments in climate mitigation in the developing countries.
The recent policy of dialogue with Belarus has borne some fruit: now almost half of all Belarusians are in favour of closer relations with the European Union.
It is all the more shocking because this train was not an old train, but a jewel of our region and it was a new route that was only opened a few years ago.
I could say that what is being built through this directive is the Europe of health.
Changes in this regard will promote cross-border trade.
For the people who live there, the prospect of accession is too important to be held hostage to the resolution of a bilateral disagreement.
Some definitions have been incorrectly transposed in 15 Member States.
The Commission's differentiated approach gives reason to hope that a unified Europe will not mean enforced uniformity, especially not during a period of crisis.
The year 2009 was one in which help was essential in order to maintain the integrity and competitiveness of the single market.
The second, in specific terms, reaffirms the principle that outstanding commitments - which are particularly high in the cohesion sector - ought to be carried out and not, as the Council suggests, simply cut out.
To date, the Cuban medical brigade has treated more than 50 000 cholera cases, enabled 76 health centres and hospitals to be rebuilt and operated on many Haitians.
It is your responsibility, Mr Reinfeldt, to say to your colleagues that a better way to deal with this is, together with the Commission, to devise one single recovery plan and to invest in sustainable energy and in the new economy.
This is why coordination between Member States needs to be improved, along with adopting a more effective and solidarity-based response geared towards prevention and the treatment of people living with dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, as well as towards supporting the people around them.
All of our resolutions, the demonstrations and the bilateral negotiations between the EU and China have brought no improvement in the human rights situation.
Anyone who does not meet the requirements of political correctness, who is an inconvenience to the EU establishment, who depicts uncomfortable realities in the EU establishment, is excluded and all of a sudden subject to other rules.
Vice-President of the Commission. - You are aware that one of the values on which the European Union is founded is the respect for the rights of persons who belong to minorities, and with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this is explicitly mentioned in Article 2 of the treaty.
That is impossible.
in writing. - I fully support this new initiative on Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
The Community fleet fishes within the strictest bounds of legality, with licences issued under the European Community - Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which regulates and manages tuna fishing in the area.
The European Union must keep its military capabilities, hold onto its military ambitions and must retain its ambition in the case of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as was pointed out in the tripartite Franco-German and Polish letter.
The reports before us today, and the European security strategy report, all conclude that the European Union can make a difference if everyone works together to ensure that we have a fully coherent policy, one which embraces the CFSP, the Community dimension and, of course, actions by Member States.
We did not quite manage that but, thanks to the work of our rapporteur, it would seem that we have obtained as good a solution as we could.
The positive points have already been mentioned, including the improvements that will be made to procurement law and I do not wish to repeat these.
In 2006, before these programmes were renewed, we, the European Parliament, were naturally aware that we do not exist in isolation, but that we should try to bring everyone else onboard with us.
(MT) The rapporteur was right in saying that a common asylum policy must be built upon the solidarity principle.
The fact that it is a scarce public resource and its cross-border scale make our intervention as EU legislators worthwhile, but we should not couch this process as a confrontation between the various uses that we could assign frequency bands.
Ever since the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko's kleptocratic regime, the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Belgian Congo and formerly Zaire) has been mired in agitation and the most brutal violence, which has already led to millions of deaths.
Principle of subsidiarity and universality of social public services in the EU (debate)
We are very grateful for the advice and I hope my colleagues and I will be able to remedy that in the forthcoming general election.
However, this also means that Parliament must in future extend its own supervisory procedures.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
With today's vote I have supported the request for budgetary discharge for 2009 for the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training.
If the European Council really believes that savings have to be made, Europe's Heads of State ought to address this matter.
Let me mention what has happened on evacuation.
The greening of payments of the first pillar will also make it possible to encourage farmers to adopt good farming practices and to be more economically and ecologically efficient.
A conspicuous example is the question of ritual slaughter.
Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty.
Just a cursory analysis indicates that Bulgaria's fishermen do not even know that such a facility and regulation exist.
It does not matter which sea has been polluted; an American, European or any other sea.
But, still in the Balkans, Croatia's bilateral border dispute with Slovenia must not be a barrier to joining the EU, and I hope that Macedonia will also be opening negotiations shortly.
These are good suggestions, but it would appear that they have fallen on deaf ears because, while the Israelis are not allowing these materials to pass into Gaza, they have had no hesitation in illegally quarrying three-quarters of the materials supplied to the Israeli construction industry from the West Bank, mercilessly destroying the natural environment, while the legal owners of the land have derived no financial advantage whatsoever.
I think that in order to tackle this growth we must improve national plans for the fight against cancer and run an even more effective information campaign for people in the EU.
The European Parliament resolution on this brutal murder is our expression of opposition to the growing brutal religious extermination in Pakistan, but also unequivocally testifies that we are not leaving religious minorities, whose rights are very commonly violated, to fend for themselves.
We have gone through full time, we are now in extra time.
This is a problem.
However, this crisis in the Mediterranean clearly shows that the issue is not only one of the credibility but of the viability of the European common immigration policy, which aims for an area of freedom, security and justice, in line with Articles 67 to 89 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
In addition, in accepting the report, the European Parliament is stating clearly that there can be no room for discrimination on the grounds of age or gender, which is particularly significant in the context of the social debate on equality of men and women in the workplace.
I am also very much in agreement with Commissioner Hedegaard that we need to ensure that there is sufficient payment into the Structural Funds to enable us to fulfil our promises to the new Member States.
I endorsed the report on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes.
In this connection, we need to bring forward truly innovative solutions and provide the right incentives through policy.
It may also be a difficult matter, but the Italians should resolve it themselves.
The present proposal is for the creation of a legal framework for the implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in Europe in the sphere of road transport and interfaces with other modes (global positioning system, automatic alarm system and traffic control instruments).
For example, it is a good thing that we have managed, on passenger transport, to reduce the obstacles to transport in districts near borders, where there is an intensive flow of cross-border transport.
If we achieve a situation in which we have secure passports and data protection laws are respected, then the European Union will have made a decisive step forwards in the interests of children and against child trafficking and child smuggling.
As we vote on this draft amending budget, which will allow for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in favour of the people of Madeira and the regions of France affected by the storm Xynthia - which, of course, we supported - it is important to highlight a few points here, in addition to the delay in mobilising the fund, which we mentioned previously.
Let us give ourselves time and not do this during the crisis.
No other major changes were voted.
However, the key competences continue to be at the Member State level.
However, that is the case according to the figures we had this morning.
It is very important that an ambitious and legally binding agreement on climate change is reached at the Copenhagen conference.
The rights of the emerging economies mean that it is in the fundamental interest of the European Union, its citizens and its Member States for us to be more united and thus more effective in advancing our causes and our interests on the global scene.
For this reason, it deserves special attention.
It is also important to take into account the different circumstances prevailing around Europe in order to ensure the survival of microenterprises operating locally.
I believe that it was a sensible move on the part of Parliament to remove the issue of meat from cloned animals from this proposal, as it is not really possible to dedicate just a few paragraphs to such a novel and new technique as the cloning of animals, even though it is normal in some countries.
Our duty in the European Parliament and on the Subcommittee on Human Rights is to remind the Council and the Commission that the results of human rights dialogues also play a very prominent role at the summits themselves.
At the same time, this new strategy needs to lay the foundations for economic growth in the EU.
This is the case in countries with very large dealers that have the capacity to distribute several brands - for example in the UK - and it is also the case in sparsely-populated areas, where it makes economic sense for the dealers to sell different brands from the same site.
Mrs Ashton did touch on some details, but her answers were disappointing.
While it is crucial not to increase the pressure on national health systems or add to the inequality in those systems, patients must have the right and the freedom to seek cross-border healthcare and must be informed about those same rights.
A number of problems relating to implementation have come to light during the process of revising the directive.
I do have one regret. It is going to take a long time to implement all these new repressive and preventative laws.
For that reason, I sincerely believe that, as well as the stick of warnings and sanctions my fellow Members are requesting, we need the carrot of European-level infrastructures.
Most important of all is that we now have a directive which must guarantee that everyone has the right to understand the authorities and the proceedings in a court of law and to be understood in such situations, which is one of the basic preconditions of the rule of law.
Taiwan requested international assistance on 12 August 2009.
This is what can be termed as solidarity between the 'poor' or, in other words, between the so-called 'cohesion countries'/convergence regions ...

Lithuania was the first country of the Soviet bloc to declare independence from the USSR.
The majority of Europe is completely fed up with the present system, in which global multinational corporations and banks rule the world.
The European Left will oppose this policy through the European Parliament and by fighting side by side with the workers and social movements to realise the hopes of the young generation for a democratic, social, feminist, ecological and peace-loving Europe.

Enabling women to reconcile their family life with their professional life, but also fulfilling gender equality objectives: that is what we are protecting today for all European women.

The debate is closed.
In this sense, ACTA will have no impact on European citizens, since it will not create new obligations for the EU and no need for implementing legislation.
In a debate like this, when we are dealing with such a topic, I believe that we should focus rather on the future measures intended to ensure that we avoid similar situations and, if you permit me to say so, it may even be more important for us to ask ourselves the question whether such figures, once they have come to public attention, are not somehow likely to reduce citizens' trust in the work of the EU institutions.

Another asymmetrical element is that we count the Palestinians who have been dramatically killed while being used as human shields, without countering this with the Israelis who have been killed and the thousands who live under threat, because bloodshed cannot be compensated by more bloodshed.
About 8 out of 10 children in the European Union use the Internet and I think we must take particular care to protect the most vulnerable children from bullying, grooming and harassment.
I must also make it clear that these criteria were set by the Member States and did not require the Commission's approval.
The social stigmatisation that continues to prevail on this issue and the continued spread of the disease, with a high mortality rate and particularly devastating effects on the least developed countries and those with the worst humanitarian situations, must mobilise the concern and commitment of the institutions of the EU and the Member States towards making actual resources available for a comprehensive and effective response, capable of ensuring the necessary harmonisation of policies for prevention and for the adequate treatment of the disease.

I will be calling on the Heads of State or Government at the European Council in June, to discuss this subject.
Let me comment on some of these areas.
Given that animal welfare is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency, and given that countries such as Ireland have already put in place successful animal welfare schemes in relation to the live transportation of animals, including the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme which helps to ensure that our weanlings for export are stronger and better prepared to cope with the journey, has the Swedish Presidency any plans to take into account schemes such as these for the live export of animals in order to ensure that a balance is reached between the sustainable export of live animals and the safeguarding of animal welfare in any new legislation?

The spell is breaking and the shamanistic incantations are losing their force.
I am baffled at the notion of extending the term of copyright, whether it is to 70 years or 95 years, and I am baffled by it not just because it is dubious and almost out of step with the digital age but also because, quite clearly, a move like that will primarily benefit industrial interests and not struggling artists.

We realise that the climate hype is abating and that climate change is becoming an ordinary, everyday issue.
Well done!
In the case of Poland, this relates mainly to the enormous potential represented firstly by the wholesale improvement of new and old buildings in terms of thermal efficiency, and secondly by the widespread replacement of old thermal power plants in residential buildings with modern thermal electric power plants.
In my opinion, the changes that were made to this agreement are not entirely convincing.
(Applause)
The fight for gender equality is a daily battle across all our States.
It has been possible to reach a balanced compromise, creating an instrument capable of dealing more effectively with this type of criminal activity, and creating more rigorous policies and making penalties more severe, including prison terms of five to 10 years and the seizure of the proceeds of crime.
I was concerned that you stated in your reply that we should ensure different levels of distribution by state and geographical area.

The very operation of the euro area is based on the concept of solidarity.
First of all, I would like to express my considerable gratitude to the Court of Auditors for its thorough work.
Bearing all this in mind, there have been both positive and negative developments.
The importance of cross-border links to progress in the European transport network is clear, which is why we support improved interconnections between all modes of transport, in particular those which have found it more difficult to transform and develop, such as rail or maritime transport.
All of us, and the Member States, too, have a lot of work to do in this area.
It is simply that we have a clash.
This is about real equality of opportunity because it should be as easy to build a Christian church in Alexandria or Ankara as it is to build a mosque in Brussels.
In these circumstances, the timing of the Nagoya Summit could not be better.
I believe that this wide-ranging debate has served to highlight that we are faced with an enormous problem, a problem that poses us an enormous challenge.

I would like to thank the rapporteur and hope that we will all have the strength to find the answer to this question: what is the Internet; can it be regulated, and if so, how should that be done?
Commissioner, I am looking forward to your proposals on corporate governance, which have been announced in the Green Paper, as that is another dossier we shall certainly be continuing to work on in the coming months and years.
I believe that the agreement will pave the way for new economic benefits, be they for consumers or airlines, and strengthen cooperation relations between both transatlantic parties, thus constituting an asset for the EU.
We cannot forget that the rise in oil prices is directly affecting fishers' incomes.
We have started on this, for now is indeed the time for implementation and out of the 14 lines of action laid down in our communication on the Internet of Things, I am happy to report that several are already on their way.
We must build safe nuclear power plants and at the same time, using structural funds, encourage rural communities to focus strategically on the link between energy, water and biotechnology, thus strengthening the diversification of the energy base.
Now we will move on.
I would like to emphasise the request for the Commission to conclude agreements containing clauses on democracy, human rights and compliance with social, health and environmental standards, and at the same time to ensure the effective monitoring of compliance with, and implementation of, these standards in practice.
This looks and feels to me like the beginnings of successful partnership.
(DE) Mr President, throughout the world 1 200 people died as a result of terrorist attacks in 2000.
I would, however, like to ask Parliament some questions and try to give some answers as to why the Commission has put forward a directive to promote the deployment of ITS and, secondly, whether the local and national initiatives in this field are not sufficient.
It is important to find an adept way out of the situation, in which the Union should show its disapproval by specific measures, such as sanctions or visa restrictions, but, at the same time, we must not isolate Belarus from the rest of Europe, because all of Belarusian society will suffer, and not the authorities condemned by the Union.
Terrorism has to be opposed, but it must not be used as a cloak to remove citizens' rights and protections.
The European Commission's policy needs to be reoriented.
I think Article 3 of the joint motion for a resolution, which expresses the will to increase aid to fishermen, is crucially important.
There is a need to increase public funding and develop more tools and programmes to encourage energy efficiency.
Those are the kinds of measures which would help bring about a development plan for Greece.

It must be stressed that these voluntary agreements on trade in timber must not run counter to the EU's overall objective in terms of combating climate change and must guarantee sustainable forest use, stop deforestation and forest degradation, and related carbon emissions and biodiversity loss globally.
This is an outrageous disgrace!
However, the euro does not sit in isolation.
We do not need regulating, Mr Borg, by the likes of you.
We should not be surprised, because the problems start at the top.

The new protocol was signed on 13 May 2011 and the request for consent was forwarded to Parliament by the Council on the same day.
Commissioner-designate Kallas seemed rather less clear, but I would remind the Commission that transport accounts for 25% of CO2 emissions and, as such, requires urgent action.

Although industry and consumers' associations are in favour of the current Directive 92/75/EEC on energy labelling, it cannot be said to have kept pace with technological developments and with innovation in the energy market because, first and foremost, there is a need to move forward from this situation of inertia throughout Europe so that a new dimension can be opened up in the lives of users.
In addition, we are delighted to see that the greening component will be a compulsory part of the first pillar, while direct payments will be shared out more evenly between individual Member States and different agricultural sectors.

I am pleased to be able to highlight, in this respect, the progress which has been made in this area in Romania over recent years, as indicated by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.

Anyone who rejects these - and I want to say this very clearly - and anyone who adopts the present resolution text unchanged, is voting in favour of allowing the MKO to carry on its policy of oppression in a camp that it controls.
The content of the report is a direct consequence of an ongoing fashionable green ideology stating that we must put nature and the planet first, that we cannot take care of people, their needs and interests.
The new Community directive creates new challenges, pressure to modernise the national health systems in the 27 Member States of the European Union and, unquestionably, the need for ongoing networking and cooperation between all the medical systems in the 27 Member States of the European Union, with the objective of exchanging best practices, promoting e-health and achieving permanent improvements in the standard of cross-border healthcare.
We know the financial crisis has meant that the financial groups that came through did so bigger and stronger.
Some of these are still not available as I speak, and I therefore wish to register my strong protest.
Cooperation of this kind would make it possible to avoid contradictory macrobudgetary scenarios and to increase the credibility of forecasts using for planning.
We in Parliament should welcome that.

He is for open trade so it is not easy for him to come to an agreement.
This example is no less important because it comes from the United States, which is, of course, the EU's ally in many areas - in fact, it is perhaps more important, because in the fight against the death penalty, there is no room for double standards.
In the context of the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) follow-up conference to the Doha round, we can also investigate the situation of the Singapore issues.

However, I regret that the mandatory indication of the minimum durability for all products, including those with a minimum durability of more than 30 months (Article 15), has not been adopted.
In this regard, we still have some tough discussions ahead of us with regard to how this will be implemented in detail in the various sectors - industry, the energy sector, transport and housing - and in the Member States.
Therefore, what happens during the Spanish Presidency is very important, because it will establish the political customs which determine the way we work, as well as the effectiveness of the European Union.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I thank you, but, in general, I hope that the Commission considers that the time is right to re-examine the guidelines on vertical restraints that you mentioned just now, since they are in fact already about 10 years old.
Parliament actually has a very significant role to play in how that research will be done.
We have clearly seen that the better the information, communication and dialogue, the larger the majority.
When that happens, we get in trouble once again thanks to pressure from the United States.
Next, we have the major challenges.
The whole world knows and recognises the key role of the EU in humanitarian aid.
(BG) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the gas crisis which Europe finds itself in at the start of 2009 is quickly assuming the proportions of a disaster for Bulgaria, which does not have an alternative to relief gas supplies.

Judge Afiuni's case is a sad reminder of Venezuela's negative attitude towards human rights.
I would like to thank everyone who spoke here for their comments.

It is bordering on a humanitarian disaster and it requires immediate action.
For years on end Bulgaria was required to make greater efforts in the fight against crime.

Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, that is right.

It goes without saying that the effects of these measures will only be evident in the long term.
Hopefully, we shall in future see an equally positive development on the after-sales market.

Mr President, energy security is an area which the EU should get involved in, and where it should act with the greatest possible degree of unity and coordination, which is not the case with many other European initiatives, and therefore we, as the European Conservatives and Reformists, support the creation of a common energy market, as this will strengthen the position of Member States vis-à-vis the main suppliers, while also limiting the scope for some suppliers of strategic raw materials to abuse their dominant position in order to play foreign policy games.

The new planned ESDP mission in Somalia, once again, will not get to the root of the problem, but merely deal with the symptoms.
The transitional national plans, together with the possibility of exemptions for large combustion plants, will slow down the modernisation process to some extent, but will, at the same time, provide national economies that depend on coal for power with an opportunity to innovate, and to do so within realistic time periods.

More particularly, I voted in favour of a large number of amendments which aimed to impose greater responsibility on transport companies in case of loss of or damage to luggage, and particularly in case of injury or death of passengers.
Last but not least, I consider it positive that the amendment stresses the responsibility of Member States for providing safe, high quality, effective and accessible care on their territory.
There are three problem areas: firstly, the disproportion in the academic world.
To this end, I agree with the rapporteur's belief that full European Parliament involvement, through the application of the Treaty of Lisbon's obligations and its joint interpretation agreed by Parliament and the Commission within the new Framework Agreement, would be crucial.

I can say, on behalf of the Commission, that we very much look forward to a constructive cooperation with you, including of course on some of the most pressing international challenges that we face, and the subject of today's debate is certainly one of those.
Within the framework of cooperation, the Union must encourage reforms that modernise social, political and judicial structures, which open the country to the outside, which expose society to free information, which promote independence of the media and which invest in the institutional capacity building of corporate and labour organisations and other organisations that are representative of civil society.
In such cases it could be justified to provide limited public financing for the projects from Member State or EU resources.

This is damage of which the consequences will continue to be felt over time, since some farming land will now be unfit for use for several years.

The Seoul Summit also created new momentum to conclude the Doha Round and reiterated the G20 commitment to fight protectionism in all its forms.
I voted in favour of the motion for a European Parliament resolution on combating female genital mutilation in the EU.
In line with the policies that I have been advocating, I consider the adoption of the policy of zero-based budgeting at the beginning of each parliamentary term important.

The second area which I believe should be a particular priority for us is the development of intercultural relations.
Our founding fathers knew that crises exist in order to be overcome and to help us build solid foundations for the future, so today, 9 May, remembering the past, we are working on the present and looking forward to the future with hope.

I call upon you to take a political decision so that the euro can be introduced in the Baltic States on an exceptional basis.

The presentation is closed.
(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, it is vitally important that we emphasise the fact that the Court of Auditors' conclusions acknowledge the progress which has been made by the Commission in controlling the absorption of European funds. However, at the same time, I hope that the recommendations and proposals made by the European Parliament in the discharge reports, reiterated for years on end, will actually be taken into consideration, especially in the areas where we still have a high level of irregularities.
Please also take note with respect to financial engineering, which is today one of the major instruments helping small and medium-sized companies access credit through JEREMIE and now also through JASMINE for micro-credit, that we started this process long before the crisis hit, so the policy has also been relatively well prepared for these difficult times.

I am proud to be associated with the United Socialist Party in Sri Lanka, which is a sister party of the Socialist Party in Ireland, and which has heroically stood up against the chauvinism of the government for the rights of the Tamil and Sinhala people and the rights of the Tamil people to self-determination.
The most important project in this regard is the Nabucco pipeline.
Commissioner, please stop stubbornly hiding behind choices made last year and take into account what is really happening on the ground now!

However, the ecosystem of the High North is relatively self-sustaining and therefore extremely sensitive.

In this respect, I would like to stress that the main objective of the cohesion policy is to make the regional economies converge by fostering the productive capacities.

All of us in this Chamber are playing a role in what we might call 'citizens' trust building'.
